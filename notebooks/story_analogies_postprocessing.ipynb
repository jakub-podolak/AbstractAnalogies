      "Both stories feature a character who is obsessed with a particular activity (astronomy in Cornelius's case, conquest and riches in King Otto's case) and neglects other important aspects of their life (maintaining their home in Cornelius's case, domestic expenditures in King Otto's case). As a result, they suffer an accident that forces them to re-evaluate their priorities and find a balance.\n",

      "* In the source story, Mark the chicken farmer is attacked by his chickens, and while they're distracted, a thief steals the eggs.\n",
      "* In story A, Linda the camp director is attacked by the girl scouts, and while they're distracted, a tidal wave washes away the sleeping bags.\n",
      "* In story B, the girl scouts attack the camp director, and while they're distracted, a tidal wave washes away the sleeping bags.\n",
      "\n",
      "The common pattern is that an event (the chickens attacking Mark, the girl scouts attacking Linda) creates a distraction, allowing a secondary event (the thief stealing the eggs, the tidal wave washing away the sleeping bags) to occur.\n",
