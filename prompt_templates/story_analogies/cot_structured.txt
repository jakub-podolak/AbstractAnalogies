Consider the following story:

Story 1: {SourceStory} 

Now consider two more stories:

Story A: {StoryA} 

Story B: {StoryB} 

Which of Story A and Story B is a better analogy to Story 1? Is the best answer Story A, Story B, or both are equally analogous?

1/ Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.
2/ Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.
3/ Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.
4/ Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.
5/ State a response: "Story A" or "Story B"
