The notation "A : B :: C : D" should be read as "A is to B like C is to D".

In the following example:

{A} : {B} :: {C} : ?

Replace the question mark with the correct analogy:

D: {D}

or

E: {D_prime}

Provide final answer in tags: <ans> D </ans> or <ans> E </ans>

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
