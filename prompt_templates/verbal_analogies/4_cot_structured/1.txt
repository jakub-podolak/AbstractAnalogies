The notation "A : B :: C : D" should be read as "A is to B like C is to D".

In the following example:

Analogy:
{A} : {B} :: {C} : ?

Replace the question mark with the correct analogy:

D: {D}

or

E: {D_prime}

Which of the completions D or E correctly completes the analogy?

1/ Briefly explain how completion D relates to the analogy.
2/ Briefly explain how completion E relates to the analogy.
3/ Compare the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy.
4/ Based on the comparisons, determine which completion (D or E) correctly completes the analogy.
5/ State the final answer. Provide final answer in tags: <ans> D </ans> or <ans> E </ans>

Only one answer is correct.
