The main similarities between the source story and Story A are:

1. The protagonist (William/Karen) dislikes a particular situation (psychiatric hospital/high school) and spends a lot of time daydreaming about something else.
2. To motivate the protagonist, someone promises a reward if they improve their situation (gingerbread from the cookie shop/trip to Hawaii).
3. Despite their best efforts, the protagonist is unable to meet the necessary requirements to receive the reward (room passed inspection/graduated from high school).
4. The protagonist is disappointed and upset by the outcome.

While Story B also involves a protagonist who dislikes school and is motivated by a potential reward, the key difference lies in when the protagonist starts preparing for the reward. In Story B, Karen begins preparing for her trip to Hawaii during the last few weeks of school, which ultimately hinders her chances of graduating. In the source story and Story A, the protagonist's daydreaming and lack of focus on the necessary tasks prevent them from improving their situation and receiving the promised reward.</s>",A,A,False,,

The source story is about a young man named Peter who moved to Florida and tried to get a tan despite not understanding the dangers of the sun. He ended up getting second-degree burns and had to go to the hospital, causing him to leave Florida.

Story B is about Quiggly Company, which also took a risk without fully understanding the consequences. Quiggly Company decided to manufacture integrated circuits and believed they needed sophisticated space factories to compete. However, they underestimated the financial risk of space manufacturing, and as a result, they spent too much money and their stocks plunged. Quiggly Company then decided to pull out of the integrated circuit market and return to making conventional electrical components.

In both the source story and story B, there is a character who desires an item (pears for Julius, records for Cindy), but they are unable to obtain it due to its expense. In both stories, the characters express some disappointment as a result. However, in story A, Cindy ultimately concludes that the records are likely not worth the cost, even if she could afford them. This is different from the source story, where Julius does not make this assumption about the pears being rotten before attempting to reach them. Instead, Julius' decision not to jump for the pears is based solely on his own weakness and inability to reach them.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>","<ans> A </ans>

The reasons for this answer are as follows:

1. In both the source story and Story A, the main character is initially frightened by a dangerous predator (lion in the source story and a beggar in Story A).
2. To escape, the main character in both stories gives something valuable to the predator, allowing them to safely flee.
3. In the source story, the shepherd realizes he is not safe and takes measures to protect himself and his flock in the future. Similarly, in Story A, Zebediah does the same by securing his remaining wealth in his house.
4. In both stories, the main character discovers that one of their possessions is missing after they have fled to safety.

Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story as it shares the same essential elements and plot points.</s>",A,B,False,,
