Let's think step by step.","Let's break it down step by step.

**Similarities between the source story and the two stories:**

1. Both stories have a protagonist who has a strong desire for something (William wants gingerbread, Karen wants to go to Hawaii).
2. Both stories have a promise made by an authority figure (the nurse, Karen's father) to provide the desired thing if the protagonist meets a certain condition (William's room being clean, Karen passing her classes).
3. Both stories have the protagonist failing to meet the condition due to procrastination or lack of effort.

**Differences between the source story and the two stories:**

1. The source story has a more immediate deadline (the monthly room inspection), while stories A/B have a longer deadline (the end of the school year).
2. The source story has a more specific and tangible reward (gingerbread), while stories A/B have a more abstract and long-term reward (a trip to Hawaii).

**Conclusion:**

Based on the similarities and differences, I think **story B** is more analogous to the source story. Both stories have a protagonist who is motivated by a promise of a reward, but ultimately fails to meet the condition due to procrastination.

Let's think step by step.","Let's analyze the source story and the two alternative stories.

The source story is about William, a patient in a psychiatric hospital who is promised gingerbread if he cleans his room, but he fails to do so and doesn't get the gingerbread.

Story A is about Karen, who is promised a trip to Hawaii if she passes her classes, but she fails to do so and doesn't get to go.

Story B is also about Karen, who is promised a trip to Hawaii if she does well in her classes, but she fails to do so and doesn't get to go.

Now, let's compare the three stories:

* In all three stories, the protagonist is promised something they desire (gingerbread, a trip to Hawaii) in exchange for achieving a specific goal (cleaning the room, passing classes).
* In all three stories, the protagonist fails to achieve the goal and therefore doesn't get the desired reward.
* The stories share a similar structure and outcome, with the protagonist being motivated by the promise, but ultimately failing to achieve the goal.

Based on these similarities, I would say that both Story A and Story B are analogous to the source story.

This is story A:

Once there was a small country called Zerdia that learned to make the world's smartest computer. Zerdia sold one of itssupercomputers to its neighbor, Gagrach, so Gagrach would promise never to attack Zerdia. But one day Zerdia was overwhelmed by a surprise attack from Gagrach. As it capitulated the crippled government of Zerdia realized that the attacker's missiles had been guided by Zerdian supercomputers.

This is story B:

Once there was a small country called Zerdia that learned to make the world's smartest computer. One day Zerdia was attacked by its warlike neighbor, Gagrach. But the missiles were badly aimed and the attack failed. The Zerdian government realized that Gagrach wanted Zerdian computers so it offered to sell some of its computers to the country. The government of Gagrach was very pleased. It promised never to attack Zerdia again.

Let's think step by step.","Let's break down the stories and identify the similarities:

Source story:
Morris, a simple-minded prisoner, is told by his cellmate to play the harmonica during the day, not at night. Morris escapes and hides in a boxcar, but then starts playing the harmonica again, thinking he should play every day. He gets caught by the cops.

Story A:
Jenny is told by her neighbor to play with her dog in her own yard, not in the neighbor's yard. Jenny refuses to listen, thinking it's bad luck to play in her own yard. She gets caught by her mother for playing in the neighbor's yard again.

Story B:
Jenny is told by her neighbor to play with her dog in her own yard. Jenny listens to this advice and goes to play with her dog in her own yard, but then sneaks out to play at the playground without doing her chores. She gets caught by her mother.

Now, let's identify the analogous elements:

* In all three stories, a character is given advice or instruction.
* The character ignores the advice or takes it too literally.
* As a result, the character gets caught or punished.

Based on these similarities, I would say that:

Let's think step by step.","Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the source story, two pioneers, Smith and Johnson, discover a valley and fight over who saw it first.
2. In story A, Betty and Norma discover a twenty-dollar bill and argue over who saw it first.
3. In story B, Betty and Norma also discover a twenty-dollar bill and argue over who saw it first.

Now, let's compare the outcomes:

1. In the source story, the conflict is resolved when Sheriff Jones divides the land evenly between Smith and Johnson.
2. In story A, their teacher, Mrs. Lee, divides the money between Betty and Norma.
3. In story B, Lee takes the money for herself, and Betty and Norma don't get to divide it.

The key similarity between the source story and story A is that an external authority (Sheriff Jones/Mrs. Lee) intervenes to resolve the conflict and divides the disputed resource (land/money) evenly between the parties.

In contrast, story B diverges from the source story because Lee takes the money for herself, rather than dividing it between Betty and Norma.

Source story:

* Two pioneers, Smith and Johnson, discover a valley and fight over who saw it first.
* Sheriff Jones intervenes and divides the land evenly between them.
* Smith and Johnson realize they should have done it themselves and become friends.

Now, let's compare this with story A and story B:

Story A:

* Betty and Norma find a twenty-dollar bill and argue over who saw it first.
* Lee takes the money before they can resolve the issue.
* Betty and Norma realize they should have divided it themselves.

Story B:

* Betty and Norma find a twenty-dollar bill and argue over who saw it first.
* Mrs. Lee, their teacher, takes the money and divides it between them.
* Betty and Norma realize they should have done it themselves.

The common element between the source story and story B is the intervention of a third party (Sheriff Jones in the source story, Mrs. Lee in story B) who divides the disputed item (land in the source story, money in story B) between the two parties. This leads to the realization that the parties should have done it themselves.
