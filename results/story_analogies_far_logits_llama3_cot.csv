1. In the source story, William is motivated by the promise of gingerbread to clean his room, but he fails to do so and doesn't get the reward.
2. In story A, Karen is motivated by the promise of a trip to Hawaii to do well in her classes, but she fails to do so and doesn't get the reward.
3. In story B, Karen is motivated by the promise of a trip to Hawaii to pass her classes, and she spends most of her time dreaming about Hawaii and preparing for the trip. However, she fails to graduate and doesn't get to go to Hawaii.

The key similarity between the source story and story A is that both William and Karen are motivated by a promise of a reward, but they fail to achieve the goal and don't get the reward.

The common thread between the source story and story A is that both involve someone boasting about their ability to avoid a problem (being late or going hungry) and then experiencing the problem despite their efforts.

Once there was a small country called Zerdia that learned to make the world's smartest computer. One day Zerdia was attacked by its warlike neighbor, Gagrach. But the missiles were badly aimed and the attack failed. The Zerdian government realized that Gagrach wanted Zerdian computers so it offered to sell some of its computers to the country. The government of Gagrach was very pleased. It promised never to attack Zerdia again.

3. In story B, Quiggly Company is trying to fit in with the competition in the integrated circuit market by going into space manufacturing, but ends up spending too much money and losing everything.

3. In story B, Cindy finds records she wants, but they're too expensive for her. She gets over her disappointment and thinks the records might be boring anyway.

The key similarity between the source story and story A is that both Julius and Cindy find something that seems unappealing (rotten pears, bad-looking records), but they're unable to get it due to circumstances (height, expense). Both stories feature a character who is disappointed by their inability to obtain something they're interested in.

In contrast, story B doesn't have the same theme of finding something unappealing. Cindy simply wants the records, but can't afford them. She gets over her disappointment, but this isn't the same as the disappointment caused by finding something unappealing.

The key similarity between the source story and story B is that both Julius and Cindy are disappointed because they can't achieve their initial goal (getting the pears or buying the records).

Cornelius was an astronomer who thought about nothing but astronomy. He was obsessed with stars and galaxies. Gradually he was turning his home into an observatory.
But before he was finished his wife Agatha complained that he was spending too much time renovating the house and not enough on his job which was astronomy. As a result, the house was no longer livable. Cornelius decided that Agatha was right and he went back to thinking about nothing but astronomy.
Then, one evening when Cornelius was walking through his house, an unfinished floor collapsed under his weight. Cornelius was severely injured but the accident showed him that he should try to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.

This is story B:

Cornelius was an astronomer who thought about nothing but astronomy. He was obsessed with stars and galaxies.
His wife Agatha complained that he was spending too much time on astronomy and not enough on maintaining his own house. As a result, the roof was gradually leaking more and more and the house was becoming almost unlivable. But Cornelius would not listen.
Then, one evening when Cornelius was walking through his house, a rotten floor collapsed under his weight. Cornelius was severely injured but the accident showed him that Agatha had been right all along. He decided to try to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.

Only one answer is correct.","Let's analyze the stories:

Story A: Cornelius is an astronomer who is obsessed with astronomy and neglects his home. His wife Agatha complains, but Cornelius doesn't listen. Then, an unfinished floor collapses, and Cornelius is injured. This shows him that he should balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.

Story B: Cornelius is an astronomer who is obsessed with astronomy and neglects his home. His wife Agatha complains, and Cornelius doesn't listen. Then, a rotten floor collapses, and Cornelius is injured. This shows him that Agatha was right all along, and he decides to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.

The source story is about King Otto, who is a warmonger who neglects his kingdom's infrastructure to focus on military conquests. He is injured when his carriage crashes through an unfinished bridge, which makes him realize the importance of balancing his military and domestic expenditures.

Comparing the stories, we can see that Story B is more analogous to the source story. Both stories feature a character who is obsessed with one thing (astronomy or conquest) and neglects another important aspect (home or kingdom infrastructure). Both stories also feature an accident that injures the character and makes them realize the importance of balance.

* In both stories, the problem escalates, and the main character runs away.
* In both stories, a secondary event occurs (the tidal wave in Story A, the girl scouts' attack in Story B) that adds to the chaos.

2. In story A, Betty and Norma discover a twenty-dollar bill and argue over who saw it first. Their teacher, Mrs. Lee, divides the money between them, and they realize they should have done it themselves.
3. In story B, Betty and Norma discover a twenty-dollar bill and argue over who saw it first. Lee (not Mrs. Lee) takes the money herself, and by the time Betty and Norma realize they should divide it, it's too late.

Comparing the stories, we can see that:

* In both stories A and the source story, a third party (Mrs. Lee in story A, Sheriff Jones in the source story) intervenes and divides the disputed item (money in story A, land in the source story) evenly between the two parties.
* In both stories, the two parties realize they should have divided the item themselves.

3. In story B, a policeman and a boy (Gene) have a confrontation, which leads to the boy hitting the policeman in the side of the head. However, the policeman becomes too dizzy to drive and they both die in a car accident.

The key similarity between the source story and story A is that both involve an unexpected and unfortunate consequence of a confrontation between two individuals, leading to their demise. In both cases, the grabbing and flying/driving away is a pivotal event that sets off the chain of events leading to their death.

Story B, on the other hand, has a different sequence of events. The boy hits the policeman, but the policeman is not grabbed and flown/driven away. Instead, they both die in a car accident due to the policeman's dizziness.
