Let's think step by step.","First, let's analyze the key elements of the source story:

1. The protagonist (William) is in a confined environment (psychiatric hospital).
2. The protagonist dislikes a certain aspect of their situation (monthly room inspections).
3. The protagonist is promised a reward (gingerbread) for improving their situation (cleaning their room).
4. Despite their efforts, the protagonist fails to achieve the desired outcome (clean room, pass inspection, get gingerbread).

Now, let's compare these elements with stories A and B:

Story A:
1. The protagonist (Karen) dislikes their situation (high school).
2. The protagonist has a goal (graduation).
3. The protagonist is promised a reward (trip to Hawaii) for improving their situation (improving grades).
4. Despite their efforts, the protagonist fails to achieve the desired outcome (graduation, trip to Hawaii).

Story B:
1. The protagonist (Karen) dislikes their situation (high school).
2. The protagonist has a goal (graduation).
3. The protagonist is promised a reward (trip to Hawaii) for improving their situation (passing enough classes).
4. Despite their efforts, the protagonist fails to achieve the desired outcome (graduation, trip to Hawaii).

Comparing the key elements of the source story with stories A and B, we can see that both stories A and B are analogous to the source story. They share the following similarities:

1. The protagonists dislike their situations (psychiatric hospital for William, high school for Karen).
2. The protagonists have goals (clean room, graduate).
3. The protagonists are promised rewards (gingerbread, trip to Hawaii) for improving their situations.
4. Despite their efforts, the protagonists fail to achieve the desired outcomes (clean room, pass inspection, graduate, go on trip).

1. The protagonist (William) is in a psychiatric hospital and struggles with keeping his room clean.
2. The nurse promises him a reward (gingerbread) if he cleans his room.
3. William fails to clean his room in time and doesn't receive the reward.

Now, let's compare these elements with stories A and B:

Story A:

2. Her father promises her a reward (trip to Hawaii) if she passes enough classes to graduate.

Story B:
1. Karen struggles in high school and despises it.
2. Her father promises her a reward (trip to Hawaii) if she does well enough in her classes to graduate.
3. Karen fails to graduate and doesn't get the trip.

Comparing the stories, we can see that both A and B share the following similarities with the source story:

1. The protagonist struggles with a task (cleaning room in the source story, passing classes in A and B).
2. A reward is promised if the task is completed (gingerbread in the source story, trip to Hawaii in A and B).
3. The protagonist fails to complete the task and doesn't receive the reward.

However, there are also differences between the stories:

1. In the source story, the protagonist is in a psychiatric hospital, while in A and B, Karen is in high school.
2. The source story focuses on the protagonist's inability to clean his room, while A and B focus on Karen's struggle with her grades.

Considering these similarities and differences, I would say that story A is more analogous to the source story than story B. Both stories involve a protagonist struggling with a task, receiving a promise of a reward, and ultimately failing to achieve the reward due to their inability to complete the task.

Let's think step by step.","First, let's analyze the key elements of the source story:

1. An older, wiser character (Karla the hawk) is being targeted by a younger, less experienced character (the hunter).
2. The older character offers something valuable (feathers) to the younger character to prevent conflict.
3. The younger character, grateful for the offer, changes their behavior and stops targeting the older character.

Now, let's compare these elements to stories A and B:

Story A:
1. Zerdia, a small country, has a valuable resource (the world's smartest computer).
2. Zerdia offers this resource to Gagrach, the warlike neighbor, to prevent conflict.
3. Gagrach, grateful for the offer, promises not to attack Zerdia again.

Story B:
1. Zerdia, a small country, has a valuable resource (the world's smartest computer).
2. Zerdia sells the computer to Gagrach, hoping to prevent conflict.
3. However, Gagrach later attacks Zerdia using the supercomputer's technology, showing that the promise not to attack was not kept.

Based on the comparison, we can see that Story A is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, the older, wiser character (Karla the hawk and Zerdia) offers something valuable to the younger character (the hunter and Gagrach) to prevent conflict, and the younger character, grateful for the offer, changes their behavior and stops targeting the older character.

Let's think step by step.","First, let's analyze the source story and the two given stories.

Source Story: Peter, a young man from Iceland, moves to Florida and tries to get a tan to fit in. He doesn't understand the dangers of sun exposure and ends up with severe sunburns. He decides Florida isn't for him and returns to Iceland.

Story A: Quiggly Company, a small company that manufactures electrical components, decides to enter the integrated circuit market and invests heavily in space factories. They don't realize the financial risk involved and end up losing a lot of money, causing their stocks to plummet. They decide to leave the integrated circuit market and return to making conventional electrical components.

Story B: Quiggly Company, a small company that manufactures conventional electrical components, starts producing integrated circuits and considers entering the space manufacturing market. Market analysts warn them about the high costs and competitive nature of the market. Despite the warnings, Quiggly decides to focus on manufacturing conventional electrical components instead.

Now, let's compare the source story to the two given stories.

In both the source story and Story A, the main characters (Peter and Quiggly Company) make decisions based on a desire to fit in or keep up with others (getting a tan, investing in space factories). In both cases, they don't fully understand the risks involved and end up facing negative consequences (severe sunburns, financial loss). In the end, they decide to change their course of action (returning to Iceland, focusing on conventional electrical components).

In Story B, the main character (Quiggly Company) receives warnings about the risks of entering the space manufacturing market, but chooses to ignore them and focus on conventional electrical components. This story doesn't have the same parallel structure as the source story and Story A.

Based on this analysis, the answer is:

Story A is analogous to the source story because both involve a character (Peter in the source story and Quiggly Company in Story A) who takes a risk due to external pressure or advice (sun exposure in the source story, market analysts in Story A). In both cases, the risk leads to negative consequences (Peter's burns, Quiggly Company's financial troubles), and the characters decide to abandon their initial plan (Peter leaves Florida, Quiggly Company stops producing integrated circuits).

Story B, on the other hand, does not have the same level of analogy to the source story. While both stories involve a company making a risky decision, the consequences and outcomes are different. In Story B, the company's decision leads to financial success, not failure, and the company remains in the integrated circuit market.

Sam travelled all over the world buying beautiful things. When he ran out of money he paid a visit to his mother. However, she was not at all pleased with him.
 ""While I have been hard at work you have been wasting your time,"" she said. Sam gave her a gift he bought in Tibet, hoping she would give him a loan in return. But she was still not pleased. ""I will not give you any of my hard-earned money!"" she exclaimed.

Source Story:
1. Percy the mockingbird sang for the squirrel expecting sunflower seeds in return.
2. The squirrel was disappointed in Percy's singing and refused to give him seeds.
3. Percy felt sad and vowed to give up singing.

Story A:
1. Sam traveled the world and spent money.
2. He ran out of money and visited his mother.
3. His mother was disappointed in him and refused to give him money.
4. Sam gave her a gift hoping for a loan in return, but she still refused.

Story B:
1. Sam traveled the world and spent money.
2. He ran out of money and visited his mother.
3. His mother was disappointed in him and refused to give him money.
4. Sam gave her a gift hoping for a loan in return, but she still refused, calling the gift ""a piece of junk.""

Now, let's compare the key elements of the source story with the key elements of stories A and B:

- In the source story, Percy sang for the squirrel in exchange for sunflower seeds. In story A, Sam gave his mother a gift in exchange for a loan. In story B, Sam also gave his mother a gift in exchange for a loan.
- In the source story, the squirrel was disappointed in Percy's singing and refused to give him seeds. In story A, the mother was disappointed in Sam and refused to give him money. In story B, the mother was disappointed in Sam and refused to give him money, also calling the gift ""a piece of junk.""

Based on these comparisons, we can see that story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, a character performs an action (singing in the source story, giving a gift in story B) expecting something in return, only to be disappointed and refused by the other character.

- In story A, the pet is saved and returns to its previous state, while in story B, the pet's condition worsens after being moved.

Based on these comparisons, we can conclude that story A is more analogous to the source story, as it shares the key elements of valuing a special pet, the pet's illness, and the pet's recovery and return to its previous state.

Let's think step by step.","First, let's analyze the key elements of the source story:

1. A valued tree (apricot tree) that produces wonderful fruit.
2. The tree withers and stops producing fruit.
3. A judge values the tree and transplants it to his own garden.
4. The tree starts producing fruit again and wins a prize.

Now, let's analyze the key elements of story A:

1. A valued canary that sings beautifully.
2. The canary becomes fatally ill and stops singing.
3. A wealthy businessman values the canary and transplants it to his city house.
4. The canary becomes ill and stops singing after being moved.

And the key elements of story B:

1. A valued canary that sings beautifully.
2. The canary becomes very ill and stops singing.
3. A veterinarian friend values the canary and transplants it to his office.
4. The canary starts singing beautiful songs again after being moved.

Comparing the key elements of the source story with stories A and B, we can see that story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, a valued object (the apricot tree in the source story and the canary in story B) faces a problem (the tree withers and stops producing fruit, and the canary becomes ill), but a person who values the object steps in and transplants it to a new location. As a result, the object starts producing fruit or singing again, bringing happiness to everyone.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>

Let's think step by step.","First, let's analyze the key elements of the source story:

1. The protagonist (Frederick) is in a vulnerable situation (tending his flock near a forest).
2. A dangerous creature (a lion) appears and threatens the protagonist.
3. The protagonist tries to escape by giving the creature something of lesser value (a lamb).
4. The protagonist successfully escapes and later discovers another loss (a missing lamb).
5. The protagonist learns from the experience and takes action to prevent future incidents (buying a blunderbuss).

Now, let's compare these elements to stories A and B:

In story A, Zebediah is in a vulnerable situation (counting money on his porch), a thief appears and threatens him, and Zebediah tries to escape by giving the thief something of lesser value (a second bag of coins). However, the story does not mention any learning or action taken by Zebediah after the incident.

In story B, Zebediah is in a vulnerable situation (counting money on his porch), a beggar appears and threatens him, and Zebediah tries to escape by giving the beggar something of lesser value (a bag of coins). Similar to story A, the story does not mention any learning or action taken by Zebediah after the incident.

Based on the comparison, neither story A nor story B is entirely analogous to the source story, as both lack the element of the protagonist learning from the experience and taking action to prevent future incidents. However, if we have to choose the one that is more similar, it would be:

<ans> A </ans>

This is because story A involves a vulnerable protagonist, a dangerous creature (a thief), and an attempt to escape by giving something of lesser value (a second bag of coins). While it lacks the learning and action-taking elements, it shares more similarities with the source story than story B.<|end_of_turn|>",A,B,False,,

3. The character feels unfairly treated and decides to take revenge.
4. The character carries out a harmful act (blowing up the captain's cabin with dynamite).

Comparing the key elements of the source story with stories A and B, we can see that story A is more analogous to the source story. Both stories involve a character who feels unfairly treated and decides to take revenge by carrying out a harmful act. The main difference is the specific situation and the method of revenge, but the overall structure and emotions are similar.

Let's think step by step.","First, let's analyze the source story and the two given stories to identify their key elements:

Source Story:
1. Pierre (cobra) and the falcon interact.
2. Pierre strikes the falcon, wounding it.
3. Falcon captures Pierre and flies away.
4. Falcon becomes too weak to fly, and they both fall to their deaths.
5. They land in the middle of an outdoor wedding ceremony.

Story A:
1. Gene and a policeman interact.
2. Gene panics and hits the policeman.
3. Policeman captures Gene and drives away.
4. Policeman becomes too dizzy to drive, and they crash, dying.

Story B:
1. Gene and a policeman interact.
2. Policeman captures Gene and drives away.
3. On the freeway, Gene panics and hits the policeman.
4. Policeman becomes too dizzy to drive, and they crash, dying.

Now, let's compare the key elements of the source story with the key elements of stories A and B:

- In the source story, there is an interaction between two animals (cobra and falcon) that leads to their mutual demise. In story A, there is an interaction between a boy (Gene) and a policeman that leads to their mutual demise. In story B, the interaction between Gene and the policeman also leads to their mutual demise.

- In the source story, the characters' actions (Pierre striking the falcon and the falcon capturing Pierre) are driven by fear and self-defense. In story A, Gene's action (hitting the policeman) is driven by panic. In story B, Gene's action (hitting the policeman) is also driven by panic.

- In the source story, the characters' fates are determined by their actions and the consequences that follow (the falcon's inability to fly and the crash). In story A, the characters' fates are determined by the policeman's dizziness and the crash. In story B, the characters' fates are determined by the policeman's dizziness and the crash.

Based on these comparisons, we can conclude that story A is more analogous to the source story than",B,A,True,6.530381679534912,9.106472969055176
