**1. Summary and comparison of themes:**
The source story, Story A, and Story B all deal with themes of loss, greed, and unfortunate consequences. The source story features a dog who loses his dinner and then loses a tooth in a scuffle over another dog's steak. Story A is about a person who breaks his own watch and then tries to take another person's watch, only to be caught by a policeman. Story B is about a person who tries to take his own reflection's watch, resulting in both watches shattering on the floor. While the specific circumstances differ, the underlying themes of loss and greed are present in all three stories.

**2. Evaluation of character relationships and development:**
In the source story, Leonard is a relatable character who makes a mistake and faces the consequences. In Story A, Charlie is also a character who makes a mistake, but his character development is limited. He is portrayed as greedy and careless, but we don't learn much more about him. In Story B, Charlie is also a greedy character, but his mistake is more absurd and comedic. The characters in all three stories are relatively one-dimensional, but they serve the purpose of advancing the plot and illustrating the themes.

**1. Summary and comparison of themes:**
The Source Story, Story A, and Story B all revolve around a person valuing a particular item (apricot tree or canary) and wanting to preserve its beauty and benefits. The themes of appreciation, loss, and the desire to preserve something valuable are common to all three stories.

**2. Character relationships and development:**
In the Source Story, Beedle is the farmer who values his apricot tree, and the judge is the one who takes the tree to his own garden. In Story A, Mr. Gerson is the owner of the canary, and the wealthy businessman takes the canary away. In Story B, Mr. Gerson is again the owner of the canary, and a veterinarian friend buys the canary. The characters' relationships and development are similar, with a focus on the person who values the item and the person who takes it away.

**3. Narrative structure:**
All three stories follow a similar narrative structure: introduction to the valued item, appreciation and loss, and a solution or resolution. The stories have a clear beginning, middle, and end, and the events unfold in a logical and coherent manner.

All three stories deal with a situation where a person is faced with a threatening situation and must find a way to escape or defend themselves. The theme of ""leaving things alone"" and not provoking the situation is present in all three stories. In the Source Story, Frederick's shouting attracts the lion's attention, while in both Story A and Story B, Zebediah's initial reactions (shouting and yelling) only make the situation worse.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In all three stories, the main character is a ordinary person who is not prepared to handle a threatening situation. Frederick, Zebediah, and Zebediah (again) are all portrayed as reasonable and rational individuals who try to find a way to escape or defend themselves. The characters' reactions to the situations are similar, with a focus on self-preservation. The development of the characters is minimal, as they are primarily reactive rather than proactive.

All three stories have a theme of chaos and unexpected events. In the Source Story, a sudden attack by chickens leads to a series of unfortunate events, including the theft of eggs. In Story A, a tidal wave washes away sleeping bags, and in Story B, the same event occurs, but with the added twist of the girl scouts attacking their director. The common thread is that unexpected events lead to chaos and challenges for the characters.

In the Source Story, Mark is a chicken farmer who is attacked by his own chickens, and his character is portrayed as frustrated and exasperated. In Story A, Linda is a camp director who is similarly frustrated with the girl scouts, while in Story B, Linda is more of a victim of circumstance, reacting to the chaos caused by the tidal wave.
