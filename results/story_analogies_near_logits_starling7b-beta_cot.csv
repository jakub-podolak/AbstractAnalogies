Once there was an eagle named Zerdia who nested on a rocky cliff. One day she saw a sportsman coming with a crossbow and some bolts that had no feathers. The sportsman attacked but the bolts missed. Zerdia realized that the sportsman wanted her tailfeathers so she flew down and donated a few of her tailfeathers to the sportsman. The sportsman was pleased. He promised never to attack eagles again.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?

Let's think step by step. Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans> at the end.

Only one answer is correct.","To determine which story is analogous to the source story, let's compare the key elements in each story:

Source Story:
1. Karla is an old hawk living in a tall oak tree.
2. A hunter with crude arrows tries to shoot Karla but misses.
3. Karla offers her feathers to the hunter, who promises not to shoot hawks again.

Story A:
1. Zerdia is an eagle.
2. Zerdia donates her tailfeathers to a sportsman, who promises not to attack eagles.
3. The sportsman later attacks Zerdia with a crossbow, using her tailfeathers as bolts.

Story B:
1. Zerdia is an eagle living on a rocky cliff.
2. A sportsman with a crossbow tries to shoot Zerdia but misses.
3. Zerdia donates her tailfeathers to the sportsman, who promises not to attack eagles again.

Comparing these stories to the source story, we can see that Story B is the most analogous:

1. Both the source story and Story B involve a bird (hawk in the source story, eagle in Story B) living in a high place (oak tree, rocky cliff).
2. In both stories, a hunter/sportsman tries to shoot the bird but misses.
3. The bird in both stories offers its feathers/tailfeathers to the hunter/sportsman, who then promises not to attack birds again.

So, the final answer is: <ans> B </ans> Story B is the most analogous to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",B,B,False,,

6. Reaches out to take the pork chop
7. The other puppy is much larger than he is

Comparing the key elements, we can see that Story B is the most analogous to the source story. Both stories involve a dog (Leonard in the source story and Charlie in Story B) holding a piece of meat in their mouth, accidentally dropping it into a body of water, and seeing another dog with a piece of meat. In both stories, the protagonist tries to take the other dog's meat, and in the source story and Story B, the other dog is larger.

Back in his cell, he devoted himself to covering the walls with obscenites.

This is story A:

A convict named Denny wished he could break out of jail. He loved to play the kazoo in jail every day but he would only play it long after dark. Eventually, the convict in the next cell got fed-up and told him to stop and always play during the daytime.
 But Denny refused to listen because he thought it was bad luck to play during the day. The last time he had done that guards had caught him right away and thrown him into solitary confinement.

This is story B:

A convict named Denny loved to play the kazoo, but he would only play it long after dark. Eventually the convict in the next cell got fed-up and told him he should always play during the day time.
 A few days later, Denny snuck out of jail and hid in a railroad car. But after awhile he began to play the kazoo because be thought the convict in the next cell had said he should play every day. Right away the police caught him and Denny wished he hadn't listened to the convict in the next cell.

2. A dangerous predator (lion and tiger) appears and threatens the flock.
3. The protagonist tries to scare the predator away, but it comes closer.
4. The protagonist gives the predator one of the animals to distract it and leads the rest of the flock to safety.
5. The protagonist discovers that another animal is missing after the incident.

In both stories, the birds are upset because their nests or eggs have been taken, and the raiser is chased away.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?

Let's think step by step. Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans> at the end.

Only one answer is correct.","Both story A and story B are analogous to the source story in different ways.

In story A, the situation is similar to the source story in that Baggle and Norton discover a valuable piece of land (the canyon) and argue over who saw it first. Sheriff Jones (Constable Leigh in story A) intervenes and divides the land between them, leading them to realize they should have done that themselves. This story has a positive resolution, as Baggle and Norton become friends and help each other build houses.

In story B, the situation is also similar to the source story in that Baggle and Norton discover a valuable piece of land (the canyon) and argue over who saw it first. However, in this case, Constable Leigh takes the land for himself instead of dividing it between them. This leads to a negative resolution, as Baggle and Norton realize too late that they should have divided the land themselves.

So, both stories A and B are analogous to the source story, but in different ways. Story A has a positive resolution, while story B has a negative resolution.<|end_of_turn|>",A,A,True,9.767168998718262,8.081836700439453

Only one answer is correct.","Both story A and story B are analogous to the source story in terms of the main plot and character motivations.

However, there are some differences in the details of the stories:

1. In the source story, Mrs. Jackson uses gasoline to set fire to the principal's office, while in story A, Professor McGhee uses kerosene to burn down the administration building.
2. In story B, Professor McGhee uses dynamite to blow up the administration building, which is a more violent and destructive act than setting a fire.
3. In the source story, Mrs. Jackson goes to a bar and gets drunk after her act of revenge, while in stories A and B, there is no mention of the characters getting drunk or engaging in any other activities after their acts of revenge.
