1/ In all three stories, the patients (William, Kevin) dislike room inspections and enjoy food. The promise of a food reward is used to motivate them to clean their rooms, but in all cases, they fail to meet the deadline and do not receive the reward. The themes of motivation, disappointment, and the struggle to maintain a clean living environment are common to all three stories.

2/ The characters in all three stories are patients in mental institutions who have a difficult time meeting the requirements for room inspections. They have a strong desire for food and are motivated by the promise of a special treat to clean their rooms. In each story, the characters are disappointed when they do not receive the reward, and their frustration leads to destructive behavior.

1. In all three stories, the protagonists, William (Source Story), Kevin (Story A and B), are patients in mental institutions who have a difficult time keeping their rooms clean. They have a strong affinity for food. In both Story A and B, the promise of a cake or gingerbread serves as an incentive for them to clean their rooms. However, in both cases, they fail to achieve their goal due to a lack of time or effort.

2. Comparing the characters, William in the Source Story and Kevin in Story A and B share certain similarities. Both have messy rooms, dislike inspections, and have a liking for food. While William's primary focus in the Source Story is daydreaming, Kevin's focus is on deciding which cake to get in Story A and B. Although unstated in the Source Story, it can be assumed William daydreams about food as well.

1. In all three stories, an inventor creates a new material for razors that stays sharper longer than previous versions. But in each story, the head of the company comes into contact with the new product and sustains a serious injury. This leads the inventor or another party to recommend a safety feature to prevent similar accidents in the future. Mr. Newton and Mr. Boyce both come to agree that the safety feature is necessary after their injuries.

2. The characters in all three stories exhibit a transformative development. Prior to their injuries, Mr. Newton and Mr. Boyce dismiss the safety feature as unnecessary due to cost concerns. However, their experiences change their perspectives, leading them to prioritize safety over cost-effectiveness.

3. Both stories have a similar narrative structure where the inventor creates a new material for sharper razors, and the company head ignores the recommended safety feature until they sustain an injury. However, the source story is more detailed, providing the context that the inventor recommended the safety feature after Mr. Newton's injury, as opposed to the source of inspiration being the injury itself in the other stories.

5/ State the final answer.","1. In all three stories, a prisoner has a habit of playing an instrument (harmonica in the source story, kazoo in stories A and B) that disturbs his cellmate. In response to the cellmate's complaint, the prisoner attempts to escape from prison, only to be caught due to following the cellmate's advice. The themes include impulsiveness, disobedience, and the consequences of listening to others.

2. The characters in Story A and Story B are similar to Morris in that they are prisoners who enjoy playing music but are influenced by their cellmates. However, while Morris becomes obsessed with playing the harmonica at night after being told to play during the day, Denny in Stories A and B refuses to change his playing habits despite cellmates suggesting otherwise. This difference highlights the effect of upbringing and personality on decision-making.

3. The structure of Story A and Story B is similar to the source story since they all include a prisoner's musical habit, a cellmate's complaint, and the resulting capture by the police after taking the cellmate's advice.

1. In both stories, an Emperor (King Otto in the source story, Emperor Cornelius in stories A and B) is obsessed with war and accumulating wealth. They prioritize military campaigns and expenditures over domestic projects, such as bridge construction (story A) or road maintenance (stories A and B). The main problem in all stories is the imbalance between military and domestic expenses. An unforeseen event (a carriage crash on a bridge in the source story and an overpass collapse in stories A and B) leads the emperor to realize the importance of maintaining domestic infrastructure and balancing their spending.

2. The characters in all three stories have similar traits: all are obsessed with war and wealth. The central conflict in each story comes from a advisor (the chamberlain in the source story, the prime minister in stories A and B) warning the emperor about the negative consequences of neglected infrastructure and inadequate funding. While the emperors initially dismiss their concerns, a personal incident ultimately changes their perspective.

3. The narrative structure is similar in that each story follows an arc where an emperor neglects domestic projects to focus on war, faces a negative event",B,A,False,,
