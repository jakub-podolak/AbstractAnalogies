Only one answer is correct.","1. In all three stories, there is a patient who dislikes inspections of their living space and spends a significant amount of time daydreaming about food. In order to motivate the patient to clean their room, a reward is offered, which is food in this case. However, the patient ultimately fails to pass the inspection and does not receive the reward. The patient becomes disappointed and reacts negatively.

Only one answer is correct.","1. In all three stories, an bird of prey (hawk in the source story, eagle in stories A and B) encounters a hunter or sportsman who wants to harm them for their feathers. The bird offers their feathers to the hunter/sportsman in exchange for a promise not to harm their kind again. The hunter/sportsman keeps his promise and focuses on hunting other animals instead. The themes of these stories revolve around sacrifice, forgiveness, and the importance of preserving life.

2. In Story A, the hawk (Karla) offers her feathers to the hunter to prevent being hunted. In Story B, the eagle (Zerdia) donates her tailfeathers to the sportsman for the same reason. In the source story, the old hawk (Karla) also offers her feathers to the hunter to avoid being hunted. The characters in all three stories demonstrate selflessness and a desire to protect their species.

3. The narrative structure of Story A and the source story are similar as both involve an encounter between a bird and a hunter, the offer of feathers, and the hunter's subsequent promise not to harm the bird's kind. Story B, however, includes an element of betrayal as the sportsman attacks and kills Zerdia despite her previous act of kindness.

4. While both stories A and B share similarities with the source story, Story A more closely aligns with the source story as it follows the same sequence of events and maintains a consistent theme of sacrifice and forgiveness without introducing the element of betrayal.

Only one answer is correct.","1. In all three stories, an bird of prey (hawk in the source story, eagle in stories A and B) encounters a hunter. The hunter intends to harm the bird for its feathers. In response, the bird offers its feathers to the hunter in exchange for a promise not to harm birds of prey in the future. The hunter keeps his promise and instead hunts other animals.

2. In the source story, Karla the hawk is portrayed as wise and generous. She takes the initiative to save herself and other hawks by offering her feathers to the hunter. In Story A, Zerdia is also depicted as wise and self-sacrificing. However, in Story B, Zerdia's actions are not motivated by a desire to save herself or other eagles. Instead, she donates her feathers out of generosity, without any knowledge of the hunter's intentions.

3. The narrative structure of all three stories is similar in that they follow a conflict between the bird and the hunter, followed by a resolution in which the hunter makes a promise not to harm birds of prey. However, in Story A, the hunter misses Karla with his arrow and she offers her feathers voluntarily. In Story B, the hunter attacks Zerdia with a crossbow and she is injured before donating her feathers.

4. Based on the themes, character development, and narrative structure, Story B is more closely related to the Source Story. In both the source story and Story B, the bird offers its feathers to the hunter voluntarily in order to save itself and other birds of prey. In Story A, while the outcome is the same, the motivation and actions of the eagle are different.

Only one answer is correct.","1. In all three stories, there is a valuable fruit-bearing tree or vine that is highly prized by the characters. The tree or vine is moved to a new location, either due to the desire of another character to possess it or because it is dying. In the source story and Story B, the tree or vine produces fruit again in its new location, bringing joy to those around it. In Story A, the tree withers and is saved by being transplanted to the judge's garden, where it bears fruit once more. In Story B, the vine is bought by the mayor and produces fruit again after being moved.

2. In the source story, Beedle is a generous farmer who shares his valuable apricots with others. The judge is a wealthy and influential figure who takes care of the tree and saves it from dying. In Story A, Mr. Gerson is a grower who shares his valuable grapes as gifts. The mayor is a wealthy and influential figure who desires the vine for his own enjoyment. In Story B, Mr. Gerson is a grower who values his vine highly and is disappointed when it dies. The mayor is a wealthy and influential figure who buys the vine to save it and restore its productivity. In all three stories, there is a transfer of ownership or care from one character to another.

3. The narrative structure of all three stories is similar in that they follow a sequence of events involving the discovery of a valuable fruit-bearing tree or vine, its transfer to a new location, and its subsequent productivity or revival. However, the order of events and the motivations of the characters differ slightly between the stories.

4. Based on the summaries and comparisons above, Story B is more closely related to the Source Story as it follows the same sequence of events and has similar character motivations. In both the source story and Story B, the tree or vine is moved to a new location due to its dying or lack of productivity, and it is saved and revived under the care of a wealthy and influential figure.

Their development as characters is similar in that they both learn the hard way that giving in to the predator's demands may not be the best solution and that they need to be better prepared to defend their herds in the future.

3. The narrative structure of Story A and Story B is similar in that they both follow a cause-and-effect sequence of events.

Only one answer is correct.","1. In all three stories, a herder is tending to his livestock at the edge of a forest. A predator appears and the herder tries to scare it away, but ends up giving the predator one of his animals to escape. In both Story A and Story B, the herder realizes that he is not safe and takes the remaining animals to a safer location. The theme of survival and protection of one's livestock is present in all three stories.

2. In the Source Story, Frederick is a shepherd who is scared of a lion and gives it a lamb to escape. In Story A, Zebediah is a cowherd who is scared of a tiger and gives it a calf to escape. In both stories, the herder is trying to protect his livestock and makes a sacrifice to do so. The development of the characters in both stories is similar as they both learn the hard way that giving in to the predator's demands may not be enough to ensure their safety.

3. The narrative structure of both Story A and Story B is similar to the Source Story in that they both follow a cause-and-effect sequence. The herder encounters a predator, tries to scare it away, realizes he is not safe, and takes the remaining animals to a safer location. The only difference in narrative structure is that in Story B, the herder falls asleep after taking the animals to safety and discovers another animal missing upon waking up.

In all three stories, the farmers (Mark in the source story, Lyle in stories A and B) are collecting or thinking about their eggs when their chickens (poultry) attack them for unknown reasons. The farmers are then chased away, leaving the eggs unguarded and vulnerable to theft.

2. The themes of ungratefulness and betrayal are present in all three stories. The farmers feel that their animals have turned against them, and they are left to deal with the consequences of the theft.

3. The characters in all three stories are farmers who raise chickens (poultry) and have a close relationship with their animals. In the source story and Story A, the farmers are directly attacked by their animals, while in Story B, the farmers are indirectly affected by the animals' behavior.

4. The narrative structure of all three stories follows a similar pattern. There is a description of the farmers collecting or thinking about their eggs, an unexpected attack by the animals, and the discovery of the theft.

5. Based on the comparisons, both Story A and Story B are closely related to the Source Story as they share the same themes, character types, and narrative structure. However, Story A has a more direct correlation as it more closely mirrors the sequence of events in the Source Story.

Only one answer is correct.","1. In all three stories, a snake encounters a bird, and as a result of their encounter, both animals meet their demise. In Story A and the Source Story, the snake strikes first out of fear, and the bird tries to teach the snake a lesson by carrying it away. However, the bird's weakness or injury ultimately leads to their shared downfall. In Story B, the roles are reversed, with the bird initially carrying the snake, but the outcome is the same, as both animals die when the bird becomes too weak to fly.

2. In both Story A and Story B, the characters are simple and one-dimensional. The snake reacts out of fear, and the bird tries to teach a lesson or carry out revenge. There is no significant character development in either story. In the Source Story, Pierre the cobra is frightened, and the falcon seeks to teach a lesson.

3. The narrative structure of all three stories is similar in that they follow a cause-and-effect sequence. The snake and the bird come into contact, and their actions lead to their mutual demise. However, the order in which the events unfold differs between the stories. In the Source Story and Story A, the snake strikes first, and the bird's injury leads to their fall. In Story B, the bird initially carries the snake, but the snake's bite causes the bird's injury and their shared downfall.

4. Based on the comparisons, Story B is more closely related to the Source Story as it follows the same sequence of events more closely. In both the Source Story and Story B, the snake strikes first, and the bird's injury leads to their shared demise.
