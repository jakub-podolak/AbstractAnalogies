Synonym,easy,simple,sad,unhappy,happy,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: easy : simple :: sad :?

Let's break it down:

* ""easy"" and ""simple"" are both adjectives that describe a level of complexity or difficulty.
* ""sad"" is an emotion.

To complete the analogy, I need to find an emotion that is similar to ""sad"" in some way. In this case, I think of emotions that are often associated with a negative or unpleasant feeling.

Based on this analysis, I believe that the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The reasoning is that ""unhappy"" is an emotion that is often associated with a negative or unpleasant feeling, similar to ""sad"".",,D
Synonym,hurry,rush,harm,injure,help,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

Let's break it down:

hurry : rush :: harm :?

The analogy is comparing two pairs of words. The first pair is ""hurry"" and ""rush"", which are both verbs that mean to move quickly. The second pair is ""harm"" and?, which is supposed to be a verb that means to cause damage or injury.

Given this, I think the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The reasoning is that ""harm"" is a verb that means to cause damage or injury, and ""injure"" is a verb that also means to cause damage or injury. This fits the pattern of the analogy, where ""hurry"" and ""rush"" are both verbs that mean to move quickly, and ""harm"" and ""injure"" are both verbs that mean to cause damage or injury.",,D
Synonym,rob,steal,cry,weep,laugh,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: rob : steal :: cry :?

Let's break it down:

* ""rob"" and ""steal"" are both verbs that mean to take something without permission.
* ""cry"" is a verb that means to produce tears as a result of strong emotions.

With this understanding, I'm looking for a verb that, like ""steal"", is related to ""rob"". In this case, I think the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The reasoning is that ""weep"" is a verb that means to produce tears, just like ""cry"". It's a more formal or poetic way of saying ""cry"", but it's still a verb that's related to producing tears.

On the other hand, ""laugh"" is a verb that's unrelated to the theme of taking something without permission or producing tears, so it doesn't fit the analogy.

So, the correct answer is <ans> D </ans>.",<ans> D </ans>,D
Synonym,polite,courteous,angry,furious,happy,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: polite : courteous :: angry :?

Let's break it down:

* ""polite"" and ""courteous"" are both adjectives that describe a person's behavior or manner, implying a positive tone.
* ""angry"" is an adjective that describes a person's emotional state, implying a negative tone.

To complete the analogy, I'm looking for an adjective that describes an emotional state that is similar to ""angry"" in terms of its negative connotation.

In this case, I think the correct completion is:

* ""beginner"" and ""novice"" are both words that describe someone who is new to a particular field or activity.
* ""doctor"" is a professional title, and we're looking for a word that is related to it.

Considering these points, I think the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The reasoning is that ""physician"" is a professional title, just like ""doctor"", and it's a more specific and formal term.",,D
Synonym,baby,infant,woman,lady,girl,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

Let's break it down:

""baby : infant :: woman :?""

The analogy is comparing two pairs of words. The first pair is ""baby"" and ""infant"", which are both related to a young human being. The second pair is ""woman"" and the unknown word.

The relationship between ""baby"" and ""infant"" is that ""infant"" is a more general term that encompasses ""baby"". A baby is a young human being, and an infant is a broader category that includes babies.

Now, let's apply this relationship to the second pair. If ""woman"" is like ""infant"", then the unknown word should be a more general term that encompasses ""woman"". In this case, the correct answer is ""lady"", which is a more general term that includes women.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,brook,stream,courage,bravery,cowardice,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: brook : stream :: courage :?

Let's break it down:

* ""brook"" and ""stream"" are both types of small bodies of water.
* The relationship between ""brook"" and ""stream"" is one of similarity or categorization (both are types of waterways).

Now, let's apply this relationship to the second part of the analogy:

* ""courage"" is a virtue or quality.
* We need to find a word that is similar to ""courage"" in some way.

After considering the options, I think the correct completion is:

The reasoning is that ""bravery"" is a virtue or quality that is similar to ""courage"". Both words describe a strong and bold character.",,D
Synonym,huge,enormous,wealthy,rich,poor,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: huge : enormous :: wealthy :?

Let's break it down:

* ""huge"" and ""enormous"" are both superlatives that describe something as very large or extensive.
* ""wealthy"" is an adjective that describes someone as having a lot of money or possessions.

To complete the analogy, I'm looking for an adjective that describes someone as having a lot of something, similar to how ""enormous"" describes something as very large.

Based on this analysis, I think the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The reasoning is that ""rich"" is an adjective that describes someone as having a lot of money or possessions, similar to how ""enormous"" describes something as very large.",,D
Synonym,cheerful,happy,awful,horrible,wonderful,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: cheerful : happy :: awful :?

Let's break it down:

* ""cheerful"" and ""happy"" are both positive emotions.
* ""awful"" is a negative word.

If we're looking for a word that is similar to ""awful"" in the same way that ""happy"" is similar to ""cheerful"", we would expect a word that is also a negative emotion.

Based on this analysis, I believe the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The word ""horrible"" is a negative emotion that matches the pattern of the analogy.",,D
Synonym,remain,stay,begin,start,continue,"I'm ready to analyze the analogy.

The analogy is: remain : stay :: begin :?

The relationship between ""remain"" and ""stay"" is that they are both forms of continuing to be in a place or state. ""To remain"" means to stay or continue to be in a place or situation, and ""to stay"" also means to continue to be in a place or situation.

If we apply this relationship to the second part of the analogy, we can see that ""begin"" and ""start"" also have a similar relationship. ""To begin"" means to start or initiate something, and ""to start"" also means to initiate or commence something.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,unusual,strange,famous,renowned,unknown,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: unusual : strange :: famous :?

Let's break it down:

* ""unusual"" and ""strange"" are both adjectives that describe something that is not normal or typical.
* ""famous"" is an adjective that describes something that is well-known or widely recognized.

With this understanding, I'm looking for an adjective that describes something that is well-known or widely recognized, similar to ""famous"".

Between the two options, ""renowned"" is an adjective that means widely known or respected, which fits the pattern. On the other hand, ""unknown"" is the opposite of what we're looking for, as it describes something that is not well-known.

Therefore, I conclude that the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,sick,ill,little,small,big,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: sick : ill :: little :?

Let's break it down:

* ""sick"" and ""ill"" are both words that describe a state of being unwell or unhealthy.
* ""little"" is an adjective that describes a small quantity or size.

With this understanding, I'm going to make an educated guess:

If ""sick"" and ""ill"" are synonyms, and ""little"" is an adjective that describes a small quantity, then it's likely that the correct completion is an adjective that describes a small quantity as well.

In this case, I think the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

Which is ""small"".",,D
Synonym,legal,lawful,usual,normal,strange,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: legal : lawful :: usual :?

Let's break it down:

* ""legal"" and ""lawful"" are related words, both describing something that is in accordance with the law.
* ""usual"" is a word that describes something that is common or typical.

Now, let's think about what word would fit the pattern. If ""usual"" is like ""usual"" (i.e., describing something common), then the word that completes the analogy should also describe something common.

In this case, I think the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

(normal is a word that describes something common or typical, just like ""usual"" does).",,D
Synonym,collect,gather,leave,abandon,stay,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: collect : gather :: leave :?

Let's break it down:

* ""collect"" and ""gather"" are both verbs that mean to bring or get things together.
* ""leave"" is a verb that means to go away from something or someone.

Now, considering the relationship between ""collect"" and ""gather"", I think the correct completion would be a verb that is also related to ""leave"".

* ""abandon"" is a verb that means to leave something or someone behind, which fits the pattern.
* ""stay"" is a verb that means to remain in a place or with someone, which doesn't fit the pattern.

Therefore, I conclude that the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D

Let's break it down:

* ""immense"" and ""colossal"" are both superlatives that describe something as extremely large or great.
* ""precise"" is an adjective that describes something as exact or accurate.

To complete the analogy, I'm looking for an adjective that describes something as not exact or accurate, but rather approximate.

Based on this analysis, I believe the correct completion is:

<ans> E </ans>

The reasoning is that ""approximate"" is an adjective that describes something as not exact or accurate, which fits the pattern of the analogy.",,E
Synonym,stone,rock,garbage,trash,bag,"I'm ready to analyze the analogy.

The analogy is: stone : rock :: garbage :?

Let's break it down:

* ""stone"" is a type of ""rock"", so the relationship between ""stone"" and ""rock"" is one of categorization or classification.
* We need to find a word that has a similar relationship with ""garbage"".

The options are:

* D: trash (trash is a type of garbage, so this option fits the categorization relationship)
* E: bag (garbage is often contained in a bag, but this is not a categorization relationship)

Based on the analysis, I conclude that:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,help,aid,raise,lift,lower,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: help : aid :: raise :?

Let's break it down:

* ""help"" and ""aid"" are both nouns that refer to forms of assistance or support.
* ""raise"" is a verb that means to increase or elevate something.

With this understanding, I'm looking for a verb that, like ""raise"", is related to the concept of increasing or elevating something.

In this case, I think the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The reasoning is that ""lift"" is a verb that means to raise or elevate something, which fits the pattern of the analogy.",,D
Synonym,rug,carpet,bucket,pail,milk,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: rug : carpet :: bucket :?

Let's break it down:

* ""rug"" and ""carpet"" are both types of floor coverings.
* ""bucket"" is a type of container.

With this understanding, I'm looking for a completion that maintains a similar relationship between the words.

In this case, I think ""pail"" is a type of container, just like ""bucket"". Therefore, I believe the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,shout,yell,leap,jump,fall,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: shout : yell :: leap :?

Let's break it down:

* ""shout"" and ""yell"" are both forms of loud vocalizations, so they have a similar relationship.
* ""leap"" is a verb that means to jump or spring forward.

With this in mind, I think the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The reasoning is that ""jump"" is a similar action to ""leap"", just like ""yell"" is a similar vocalization to ""shout"".",,D
Opposite,artificial,natural,friend,enemy,relative,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: artificial : natural :: friend :?

Let's break it down:

* ""artificial"" and ""natural"" are two contrasting concepts, suggesting a relationship between them.
* ""friend"" is a type of relationship, implying that the analogy is comparing relationships.

Now, let's consider the two potential completions:

* D: enemy - This completion suggests a contrasting relationship, which fits with the ""artificial"" and ""natural"" contrast. Enemies are often seen as opposing forces, much like artificial and natural are opposing concepts.
* E: relative - This completion doesn't quite fit the contrast between ""artificial"" and ""natural"". Relatives are often related by blood or family ties, which doesn't capture the same level of contrast as ""artificial"" and ""natural"".

Based on the analysis, I believe the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The analogy suggests that ""friend"" is to ""enemy"" like ""artificial"" is to ""natural"", implying a contrasting relationship.",,D
Opposite,love,hate,rich,poor,wealthy,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: love : hate :: rich :?

The relationship between ""love"" and ""hate"" is that they are both strong emotions, but opposite in nature. They are antonyms.

If we apply this relationship to the second part of the analogy, we can infer that ""rich"" and the unknown term should also be antonyms.

The options are:

D: poor
E: wealthy

Since ""rich"" and ""poor"" are antonyms, I believe the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Opposite,alive,dead,succeed,fail,conquer,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: alive : dead :: succeed :?

Let's break it down:

* ""alive"" and ""dead"" are antonyms, meaning they are opposite states.
* ""succeed"" and? should also be antonyms, meaning they are opposite states.

Now, let's consider the two options:

* D: fail - ""succeed"" and ""fail"" are antonyms, which fits the pattern.
* E: conquer - ""succeed"" and ""conquer"" don't seem to be antonyms, as ""conquer"" implies winning or achieving something, whereas ""succeed"" implies achieving a goal.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that:

<ans> D </ans>

The correct completion is indeed ""fail"".",,D
Opposite,ugliness,beauty,joy,sorrow,emotion,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: ugliness : beauty :: joy :?

Let's break it down:

* ugliness and beauty are antonyms, meaning they are opposite in meaning.
* joy and? should also be antonyms, meaning they should have opposite meanings.

Now, let's look at the two potential completions:

* D: sorrow - Sorrow is indeed an antonym of joy, so this completion seems plausible.
* E: emotion - Emotion is a broad term that encompasses many feelings, including joy, but it's not an antonym of joy.

Based on the analysis, I believe that:

<ans> D </ans>

is the correct completion.",,D
Opposite,huge,tiny,arrive,depart,come,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: huge : tiny :: arrive :?

Let's break it down:

* huge and tiny are antonyms, meaning they are opposite in size or magnitude.
* arrive and? should also be antonyms, meaning they are opposite in some sense.

Now, let's consider the two options:

* D: depart - This is a great fit! Arrive and depart are antonyms, as they describe the opposite ends of a journey or movement.
* E: come - This doesn't quite fit. While come and arrive are related, they're not exact antonyms. Come can imply arrival, but it's not the opposite of arrive.

Based on this analysis, I'm confident that the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Opposite,somber,cheerful,lawyer,client,doctor,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: somber : cheerful :: lawyer :?

Let's break it down:

* ""somber"" and ""cheerful"" are two adjectives that describe emotions or moods.
* ""lawyer"" is a profession.

To complete the analogy, I need to find a profession that is related to the lawyer in a similar way that ""cheerful"" is related to ""somber"".

In this case, a lawyer typically has a client, which is a person who hires the lawyer's services. This relationship is similar to how ""cheerful"" is the opposite of ""somber"", as a client is the opposite of a profession.

Therefore, I conclude that the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Opposite,late,early,win,lose,capture,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: late : early :: win :?

Let's break it down:

* ""late"" and ""early"" are antonyms, meaning they are opposite in time or schedule.
* ""win"" is a verb that implies success or achievement.

With this understanding, I'll examine the two potential completions:

* D: lose (lose is an antonym of win, implying failure or lack of success)
* E: capture (capture is not an antonym of win, and it doesn't fit the pattern of antonyms)

Based on the analogy, I believe that the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The analogy suggests that ""late"" is to ""early"" as ""win"" is to ""lose"", implying a reversal or opposite outcome.",,D
Opposite,quick,slow,grow,wither,plant,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: quick : slow :: grow :?

Let's break it down:

* ""quick"" and ""slow"" are antonyms, meaning they are opposite in some way.
* ""grow"" is a verb that means to increase in size or amount.

Now, let's consider the two potential completions:

* D: wither: Wither is a verb that means to shrink or dry up, which is the opposite of growing. This seems like a good fit, as it maintains the antonymic relationship between the two pairs of words.
* E: plant: Plant is a verb that means to put a seed or seedling into the ground, which doesn't seem to fit the pattern of antonyms.

Based on this analysis, I believe the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

Wither is the correct analogy to complete the given analogy.",,D
Opposite,antonym,synonym,selfish,generous,egocentric,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The analogy is: antonym : synonym :: selfish :?

Let's break it down:

* ""antonym"" and ""synonym"" are both words that describe relationships between words.
* ""antonym"" means a word that is opposite in meaning, while ""synonym"" means a word that has the same or nearly the same meaning.
* ""selfish"" is a word that describes a person's behavior or attitude.

Now, let's think about what kind of word would be the opposite of ""selfish"". A word that describes a person's behavior or attitude that is the opposite of selfish would be... generous!

So, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Opposite,quiet,noisy,last,first,final,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: quiet : noisy :: last :?

Let's break it down:

* ""quiet"" and ""noisy"" are antonyms, meaning they are opposite in some way (e.g., volume).
* ""last"" is likely to be paired with an antonym that is also related to sequence or order.

Considering the analogy, I think the correct completion is:

<ans> E </ans>

The reasoning is that ""last"" is often paired with ""first"" in antonymic relationships, and ""final"" is also an antonym of ""initial"" or ""beginning"". Therefore, the analogy suggests that ""last"" is to ""first"" like ""quiet"" is to ""noisy"", and ""final"" is the correct completion.",,E
Opposite,start,stop,trivial,important,famous,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: start : stop :: trivial :?

Let's break it down:

* ""start"" and ""stop"" are antonyms, meaning they are opposite in meaning.
* ""trivial"" is likely to have an antonym that is also a type of opposite.

Considering the options:

* D: important - ""important"" and ""trivial"" are not direct antonyms, but ""important"" is a more positive connotation, which could be seen as an opposite of ""trivial"".
* E: famous - ""famous"" and ""trivial"" are not antonyms, and ""famous"" doesn't have a clear opposite meaning in this context.

Based on the analysis, I believe the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The analogy suggests that ""start"" and ""stop"" are opposite, and ""trivial"" and ""important"" have a similar opposite relationship.",,D
Opposite,laugh,cry,cheap,expensive,inexpensive,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: laugh : cry :: cheap :?

Let's break it down:

* ""laugh"" and ""cry"" are both emotions or feelings.
* ""cheap"" and? are both adjectives describing something.

Now, considering the relationship between ""laugh"" and ""cry"", I think it's likely that the correct completion will describe the opposite of ""cheap"".

* ""cheap"" implies something is inexpensive or of low value.
* The opposite of ""cheap"" would be something that is expensive or of high value.

With this in mind, I'm going to choose the completion that suggests something is expensive.

So, my answer is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Opposite,accept,reject,dark,bright,dim,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: accept : reject :: dark :?

The relationship between ""accept"" and ""reject"" is that they are both opposite actions. ""Accept"" means to receive or agree with something, while ""reject"" means to refuse or decline something.

Now, let's look at the relationship between ""dark"" and the unknown term. The relationship seems to be that ""dark"" is the opposite of a certain state or condition. In this case, the opposite of ""dark"" is likely to be a state of brightness.

Comparing the two relationships, we can see that the correct analogy is:

accept : reject :: dark : bright

So, the correct answer is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Opposite,abundant,scarce,agree,disagree,concur,"I'm ready to analyze the analogy.

The analogy is: abundant : scarce :: agree :?

The relationship between ""abundant"" and ""scarce"" is that they are antonyms, meaning they are opposite in meaning.

If we apply this relationship to the second part of the analogy, we can see that ""agree"" and ""disagree"" are also antonyms.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Opposite,hero,coward,strong,weak,muscular,"I'm ready to analyze the analogy.

The analogy is: hero : coward :: strong :?

The relationship between ""hero"" and ""coward"" is that a hero is the opposite of a coward. A hero is someone who is brave and courageous, while a coward is someone who is afraid and lacks courage.

Applying this relationship to the second part of the analogy, we can conclude that ""strong"" is the opposite of ""weak"", not ""muscular"". A strong person is not necessarily muscular, but they may be physically fit and capable.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Opposite,teacher,student,calm,stormy,serene,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The analogy is: teacher : student :: calm :?

Let's break it down:

* ""teacher"" and ""student"" are related in a specific way, which is a teacher-student relationship.
* ""calm"" and? are also related in a specific way.

The relationship between ""teacher"" and ""student"" is that a teacher is typically associated with a calm and composed demeanor, whereas a student is often associated with a more energetic and restless state.

With this in mind, I think the correct completion is:

<ans> E </ans>

The analogy suggests that ""calm"" is to ""serene"" like ""teacher"" is to ""student"", implying a sense of peacefulness and composure.",,E
Opposite,give,take,allow,forbid,permit,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: give : take :: allow :?

Let's break it down:

* ""give"" and ""take"" are antonyms, meaning they are opposite actions.
* ""allow"" is a verb that means to permit or consent to something.

Considering the analogy, I think it's likely that the correct completion is related to the opposite action of ""allow"".

* ""forbid"" is a verb that means to prohibit or prevent something, which is the opposite of ""allow"".
* ""permit"" is a verb that means to give permission or consent to something, which is similar to ""allow"".

Based on this analysis, I believe the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

Please let me know if I'm correct!",,D
Opposite,clean,dirty,awake,asleep,alert,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: clean : dirty :: awake :?

Let's break it down:

* ""clean"" and ""dirty"" are antonyms, meaning they are opposite in meaning.
* ""awake"" and? should also be antonyms, meaning they are opposite in meaning.

Now, let's consider the two options:

* D: asleep - This is a great fit! ""asleep"" is the opposite of ""awake"", just like ""dirty"" is the opposite of ""clean"".
* E: alert - This doesn't quite fit. ""alert"" is not the opposite of ""awake"", as both words describe a state of being awake and aware.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Opposite,remember,forget,increase,decrease,lengthen,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: remember : forget :: increase :?

Let's break it down:

* ""remember"" and ""forget"" are antonyms, meaning they are opposite actions.
* ""increase"" and? should also be antonyms, meaning they are opposite actions.

Now, let's consider the options:

* D: decrease - This is a great fit! ""decrease"" is the opposite of ""increase"", just like ""forget"" is the opposite of ""remember"".
* E: lengthen - This doesn't quite fit. ""lengthen"" is not the opposite of ""increase"", as it's a different type of action (increasing size vs. increasing quantity).

Based on the analysis, I'm confident that the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Opposite,crazy,sane,bent,straight,crooked,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The analogy is: crazy : sane :: bent :?

Let's break it down:

* ""crazy"" and ""sane"" are antonyms, meaning they are opposite in meaning.
* ""bent"" is a word that can be used to describe something that is not straight.

With this in mind, I think the correct completion is:

<ans> E </ans>

The reasoning is that ""crooked"" is also an antonym of ""straight"", just like ""crazy"" is an antonym of ""sane"".",,E
Function,fly,bird,hop,rabbit,leg,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: fly : bird :: hop :?

Let's break it down:

* ""fly"" is a verb that birds do (i.e., birds fly).
* ""hop"" is a verb that...?

The correct completion should have a similar relationship between the verb and the noun. In this case, ""hop"" is a verb that rabbits do (i.e., rabbits hop).

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Function,build,house,dig,hole,shovel,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: build : house :: dig :?

Let's break it down:

* ""build"" is a verb that creates a ""house"".
* ""dig"" is a verb that creates a ""hole"" (or a pit).

The analogy is suggesting that just as ""build"" is related to ""house"", ""dig"" is related to ""hole"".

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Function,sing,song,ride,horse,rider,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: sing : song :: ride :?

Let's break it down:

* ""sing"" is a verb, and ""song"" is a noun that is the result of singing.
* ""ride"" is a verb, and we're looking for a noun that is the result of riding.

In this case, the correct completion would be a noun that is commonly associated with riding.

Comparing the options:

* D: horse - This makes sense! A horse is a common noun that is often the result of riding.
* E: rider - This doesn't quite fit. A rider is a person who rides, but it's not the direct result of riding.

Based on this analysis, I'm confident that the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Function,hear,ear,wear,clothes,woman,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: hear : ear :: wear :?

Let's break it down:

* ""hear"" is related to ""ear"" in some way.
* ""wear"" is related to? in some way.

The relationship between ""hear"" and ""ear"" is that ""hear"" is an action that is performed through the use of the ""ear"". In other words, you use your ear to hear.

Now, let's think about the relationship between ""wear"" and?. If we follow the same pattern as the first part of the analogy, we can infer that ""wear"" is an action that is performed through the use of?. In this case, the correct completion would be something that is worn on the body.

Given the options, I believe that ""clothes"" is the correct completion, as you wear clothes on your body.

Function,drive,car,burn,wood,fire,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: drive : car :: burn :?

Let's break it down:

* ""drive"" is a verb that is associated with ""car"", which is a noun.
* The relationship between ""drive"" and ""car"" seems to be one of action and object.

Now, let's consider the two potential completions:

* D: wood
* E: fire

For D: wood, the relationship between ""burn"" and ""wood"" is also one of action and object, which is similar to the relationship between ""drive"" and ""car"". This seems like a plausible completion.

For E: fire, the relationship between ""burn"" and ""fire"" is more like a cause-and-effect relationship, where ""burn"" is an action that is caused by ""fire"". This doesn't seem to match the relationship between ""drive"" and ""car"" as well.

Based on this analysis, I'm going to choose the completion that seems more similar in terms of the relationship between the words:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Function,open,door,touch,hands,doctor,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: open : door :: touch :?

Let's break it down:

* ""open"" is a verb that is often associated with ""door"", implying that the door is opened.
* ""touch"" is a verb that is often associated with... what?

In this case, the correct association is ""hands"". We often touch things with our hands.

So, the correct completion is: <ans> D </ans>",,D
Function,squeeze,juice,shoot,gun,miss,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: squeeze : juice :: shoot :?

Let's break it down:

* ""squeeze"" is a verb that produces ""juice"" as a result.
* ""shoot"" is a verb that... Hmm, what is the result of ""shoot""?

In this case, the result of ""shoot"" is often a ""bullet"" or something that comes out of a ""gun"". So, the correct completion would be:

<ans> D </ans>

The analogy is: squeeze : juice :: shoot : gun",,D
Function,cut,knife,hit,hammer,nail,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: cut : knife :: hit :?

Let's break it down:

* ""cut"" is an action, and ""knife"" is the tool used to perform that action.
* Similarly, ""hit"" is an action, and we need to find the tool used to perform that action.

Based on this understanding, I think the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The reasoning is that a hammer is a common tool used to hit or strike something, just like a knife is used to cut something.",,D
Function,throw,ball,open,envelope,close,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: throw : ball :: open :?

Let's break it down:

* ""throw"" is an action, and ""ball"" is the object being thrown.
* ""open"" is an action, and we need to find the object or thing being opened.

In this case, a common association is that when you ""open"" something, you're often opening an ""envelope"". This makes sense, as envelopes are typically opened to reveal the contents inside.

So, based on this analysis, I believe the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

Am I correct?",,D
Function,read,magazine,play,football,kids,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The analogy is: read : magazine :: play :?

Let's break it down:

* ""read"" is a verb, and ""magazine"" is a noun that is often associated with reading (e.g., reading a magazine).
* ""play"" is a verb, and we need to find a noun that is often associated with playing (e.g., playing a sport).

Based on this analysis, I think the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The reasoning is that ""football"" is a sport that is often played, just like a magazine is often read.",,D
Function,carry,suitcase,sit,chair,job,"I'm ready to analyze the analogy.

The analogy is: carry : suitcase :: sit :?

The relationship between ""carry"" and ""suitcase"" is that ""carry"" is an action that is often performed with a ""suitcase"". This suggests that the analogy is comparing actions with objects.

The options are:

D: chair
E: job

Let's consider each option:

D: chair - This doesn't seem to fit the pattern. ""Sit"" is an action that is often performed on a ""chair"", but ""sit"" is not an action that is often performed with a ""chair"".

E: job - This could fit the pattern. ""Sit"" is an action that is often performed at a ""job"" (e.g., sitting at a desk), and ""carry"" is an action that is often performed with a ""suitcase"" (e.g., carrying a suitcase to a job).

Based on this analysis, I think the correct completion is:

<ans> E </ans>",,E

* Similarly, ""cook"" is an action, and we need to find the container or tool used for that action.

Based on this understanding, I believe the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The analogy suggests that just as a ""glass"" is used for ""drinking"", a ""pan"" is used for ""cooking"".",,D
Function,burn,fire,blow,wind,down,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: burn : fire :: blow :?

Let's break it down:

* ""burn"" is a verb that means to damage or destroy something by heat or flames.
* ""fire"" is the noun that is related to the verb ""burn"", referring to a source of heat or flames.

Now, let's look at the second part of the analogy: blow :?

* ""blow"" is a verb that means to move air or gas through the mouth or nose.
* We need to find a noun that is related to the verb ""blow"", just like ""fire"" is related to the verb ""burn"".

A common noun that is related to the verb ""blow"" is ""wind"". Wind is a natural movement of air that can be felt or seen.

So, based on this analysis, I believe the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The analogy is: burn : fire :: blow : wind",,D
Function,ski,snow,swim,water,swimmer,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: ski : snow :: swim :?

Let's break it down:

* ""ski"" is related to ""snow"" in some way.
* The relationship between ""ski"" and ""snow"" is likely one of association or environment. Skiing typically takes place on snow.
* Now, we need to find a similar relationship between ""swim"" and the unknown term.

Based on the analogy, I'm going to take a guess that the relationship between ""swim"" and the unknown term is also one of association or environment. Swimming typically takes place in a medium, and that medium is often ""water"".

So, I'm going to choose the completion that suggests a similar relationship:

<ans> D </ans>

Am I correct?",,D

I think I have it!

* ""fight"" is a verb that is related to a ""battle"".

So, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Function,run,horse,pull,tractor,muscle,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: run : horse :: pull :?

Let's break it down:

* ""run"" is an action performed by a ""horse"".
* We need to find a word that is an action performed by a corresponding word.

For ""pull"", I think of actions that are typically performed by a specific entity. In this case, ""pull"" is an action that is often performed by a ""tractor"" (e.g., a tractor pulls a plow or a trailer).

On the other hand, ""pull"" can also be an action performed by a ""muscle"" (e.g., a muscle pulls a bone or a tendon).

So, based on the analogy, I think the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

A tractor is the entity that typically performs the action of pulling, whereas a muscle is a part of the body that performs the action of pulling.",,D
Function,write,poem,carve,statue,knife,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The analogy is: write : poem :: carve :?

Let's break it down:

* ""write"" is a verb that creates a ""poem"", which is a type of written work.
* ""carve"" is a verb that creates a ""statue"", which is a type of three-dimensional artwork.

Let's break it down:

* ""ride"" is a verb, and ""bicycle"" is a noun that is often used for riding.
* ""drink"" is a verb, and we need to find a noun that is often used for drinking.

In this case, a common noun associated with drinking is a ""cup"". You can drink from a cup.

So, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Function,throw,ball,jump,parachute,walk,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: throw : ball :: jump :?

Let's break it down:

* ""throw"" is an action, and ""ball"" is the object being thrown.
* ""jump"" is an action, and we need to find the object or thing associated with it.

In this case, the correct completion would be something that is typically associated with jumping. A parachute is not typically associated with jumping, as it's used for slowing down descent from a great height.

On the other hand, ""walk"" is an action that is often preceded by jumping, as in ""I jumped and then walked away"".

So, based on this analysis, I conclude that:

<ans> E </ans>",,E
Function,ride,elevator,sail,boat,wind,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The analogy is: ride : elevator :: sail :?

Let's break it down:

* ""ride"" is a way of traveling, and ""elevator"" is a means of traveling (e.g., a lift).
* ""sail"" is a way of traveling, and we need to find a means of traveling that is associated with it.

In this case, the correct completion is likely to be a type of vessel that is used for sailing. Therefore, I believe the correct answer is:

Category Members,vegetable,cabbage,insect,beetle,frog,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The analogy is: vegetable : cabbage :: insect :?

Let's break it down:

* ""vegetable"" is a category, and ""cabbage"" is a specific type of vegetable.
* ""insect"" is a category, and we're trying to find a specific type of insect that fits the analogy.

The relationship between ""vegetable"" and ""cabbage"" is that ""cabbage"" is a type of vegetable. Similarly, the relationship between ""insect"" and the correct answer should be that the correct answer is a type of insect.

Comparing the options:

* ""beetle"" is a type of insect, so it fits the analogy.
* ""frog"" is not a type of insect, it's an amphibian, so it doesn't fit the analogy.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Category Members,insect,bee,fish,halibut,water,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The analogy is: insect : bee :: fish :?

The relationship between ""insect"" and ""bee"" is that ""bee"" is a type of ""insect"". This is a classification relationship.

Now, let's apply this relationship to the second part of the analogy. If ""fish"" is the category, and we're looking for a type of ""fish"", then the correct completion would be a type of fish.

Between the two options, ""halibut"" is a type of fish, whereas ""water"" is a medium where fish live, not a type of fish.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Category Members,flower,rose,bird,pigeon,nest,"I'm excited to analyze the analogy!

The given analogy is: flower : rose :: bird :?

Let's break it down:

* ""flower"" is a type of ""rose"" (a specific type of flower)
* We're looking for a relationship between ""bird"" and the unknown term

A possible relationship between ""bird"" and the unknown term could be that ""bird"" is a type of the unknown term. If that's the case, we're looking for a specific type of bird.

Comparing the two pairs, we see that ""rose"" is a specific type of ""flower"", so we might be looking for a specific type of ""bird"".

With that in mind, I think the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The reasoning is that ""pigeon"" is a specific type of bird, just like ""rose"" is a specific type of flower.",,D

* Similarly, ""insect"" is a general category, and we need to find a specific type of insect.

Now, let's look at the two potential completions:

* D: mosquito (a specific type of insect)
* E: sting (not a type of insect, but rather a characteristic of some insects)

Based on the analogy, I believe that the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

Mosquito is a specific type of insect, just like wren is a specific type of bird.",,D

* ""vehicle"" is a category, and we're trying to find a specific type of vehicle.

The analogy suggests that the relationship between ""sport"" and ""soccer"" is similar to the relationship between ""vehicle"" and the correct answer.

In this case, both ""sport"" and ""vehicle"" are categories, and the correct answer should be a specific type of vehicle.

Comparing the options:

* D: bus - This is a specific type of vehicle, which fits the analogy.
* E: engine - This is a part of a vehicle, not a type of vehicle.

Based on the analysis, I conclude that:

<ans> D </ans>",,D

The given analogy is: weapon : pistol :: clothing :?

Let's break it down:

* ""weapon"" is a type of ""pistol"", which is a specific type of weapon.
* We're looking for a relationship between ""clothing"" and the unknown term.

A possible relationship is that ""pistol"" is a specific type of ""weapon"", just like ""shoes"" is a specific type of ""clothing"". This would make ""shoes"" a plausible completion.

So, the analogy is saying that ""sport"" is a category of things, and we need to find a specific type of sport that fits the analogy.

Now, let's look at the two options:

* D: golf - Golf is a specific sport, so it fits the analogy.
* E: coat - Coat is not a sport, it's a type of clothing, so it doesn't fit the analogy.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that:
