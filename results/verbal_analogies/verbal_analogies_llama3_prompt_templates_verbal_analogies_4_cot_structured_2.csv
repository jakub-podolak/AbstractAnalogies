Synonym,easy,simple,sad,unhappy,happy,"I'm ready to help. Let's analyze the analogy:

Analogy:
easy : simple :: sad :?

**Completion D: unhappy**

1. Completion D relates to the analogy by suggesting that ""sad"" is to ""unhappy"" as ""easy"" is to ""simple"". This is because both ""unhappy"" and ""simple"" are antonyms of the corresponding words (""happy"" and ""complex"").
2. Completion E relates to the analogy by suggesting that ""sad"" is to ""happy"" as ""easy"" is to ""simple"". This is because both ""happy"" and ""simple"" are antonyms of the corresponding words (""sad"" and ""complex""), but this relationship is not as direct as the one in completion D.

**Comparison**

Completion D presents a more direct relationship between the words, as both ""unhappy"" and ""simple"" are antonyms of the corresponding words. Completion E, on the other hand, presents a less direct relationship, as the antonyms are not as closely related.

Opposite,quiet,noisy,last,first,final,"I'm ready to help. Let's analyze the analogy:

Analogy:
quiet : noisy :: last :?

**1. Briefly explain how completion D relates to the analogy.**
Completion D, ""first"", suggests that the analogy is comparing opposites. ""Quiet"" and ""noisy"" are antonyms, and ""first"" and ""last"" are also antonyms in a sequence.

**2. Briefly explain how completion E relates to the analogy.**
Completion E, ""final"", also suggests a relationship between the words, but it's not as clear-cut as completion D. ""Final"" is an adjective that can describe the last item in a sequence, but it's not a direct opposite of ""last"".

**3. Compare the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy.**
Completion D, ""first"", provides a clear antonymic relationship between ""quiet"" and ""noisy"", and ""last"" and ""first"". This relationship is consistent with the analogy.

Analogy:
laugh : cry :: cheap :?

**Completion D: expensive**

1. Completion D relates to the analogy by suggesting that ""cheap"" is to ""expensive"" as ""laugh"" is to ""cry"". This is because ""laugh"" and ""cry"" are both emotions, and ""cheap"" and ""expensive"" are both adjectives describing something's price.
2. Completion D does not explicitly state the relationship between ""laugh"" and ""cry"", but it implies that they are both emotions, which is true.
3. The relationship between ""laugh"" and ""cry"" is that they are both emotions, and the relationship between ""cheap"" and ""expensive"" is that they are both adjectives describing something's price. Completion D captures this relationship.

Opposite,abundant,scarce,agree,disagree,concur,"I'm ready to help. Let's analyze the analogy:

Analogy:
abundant : scarce :: agree :?

**1. Briefly explain how completion D relates to the analogy.**
Completion D, ""disagree"", suggests that when something is abundant, it's the opposite of scarce, and when we agree, it's the opposite of disagree. This completion seems to be based on the idea of antonyms.

**2. Briefly explain how completion E relates to the analogy.**
Completion E, ""concur"", suggests that when something is abundant, it's similar to scarce, and when we agree, it's similar to concur. This completion seems to be based on the idea of synonyms.

**3. Compare the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy.**
The analogy is based on the relationship between two pairs of words. The first pair, ""abundant : scarce"", suggests a contrast or opposition between the two words. The second pair, ""agree :?"", should also convey a similar contrast or opposition.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which completion (D or E) correctly completes the analogy.**
Completion D, ""disagree"", fits the analogy better because it conveys a contrast or opposition between ""agree"" and ""disagree"", similar to the contrast between ""abundant"" and ""scarce"".

**1. Briefly explain how completion D relates to the analogy.**
Completion D, ""weak"", suggests that a hero is strong, and a coward is weak. This completion implies that the relationship between ""strong"" and ""weak"" is one of opposition or contrast.

**2. Briefly explain how completion E relates to the analogy.**
Completion E, ""muscular"", doesn't seem to have a direct connection to the analogy. Muscularity is a physical characteristic, whereas the analogy is comparing a hero to a coward, and strength to an unknown term.

**3. Compare the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy.**
Completion D presents a relationship of opposition or contrast between ""strong"" and ""weak"", which is similar to the relationship between ""hero"" and ""coward"" (a hero is the opposite of a coward). Completion E, on the other hand, doesn't present a clear relationship between ""strong"" and the unknown term.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which completion (D or E) correctly completes the analogy.**
Based on the analysis, completion D (""weak"") is more closely related to the analogy, as it presents a relationship of opposition or contrast between ""strong"" and ""weak"", similar to the relationship between ""hero"" and ""coward"".

Analogy:
teacher : student :: calm :?

**Completion D: stormy**

1. Completion D relates to the analogy by suggesting that a teacher is to a student as a calm person is to a stormy person. This implies that the teacher is the opposite of the student, which doesn't make sense in this analogy.
2. Completion D doesn't provide a logical connection between the two pairs of words.

**Completion E: serene**

1. Completion E relates to the analogy by suggesting that a teacher is to a student as a calm person is to a serene person. This implies that the teacher is the one who is calm or peaceful, while the student is the one who is serene or peaceful as well. This relationship makes sense in the analogy.
2. Completion E provides a logical connection between the two pairs of words, where both the teacher and student are associated with calm or peaceful states.

**Comparison**

Completion D doesn't provide a logical connection between the two pairs of words, while Completion E does. The relationship between the teacher and student is not about opposition, but rather about a shared characteristic.

**Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, I conclude that Completion E correctly completes the analogy.

Opposite,give,take,allow,forbid,permit,"I'm ready to help. Let's analyze the analogy:

Analogy:
give : take :: allow :?

**Completion D: forbid**
Forbid is a verb that means to prohibit or prevent something from happening. In this context, it seems to be related to the analogy because ""give"" and ""take"" are actions that involve possession or control, and ""forbid"" could be seen as a way to restrict or deny permission. However, this relationship is not as direct as the one in the analogy.

**Completion E: permit**
Permit is a verb that means to give permission or authorization for something to happen. In this context, it seems to be a more direct match for the analogy. ""Give"" and ""take"" are actions that involve possession or control, and ""permit"" is a way to allow or grant permission for something to happen. This relationship is more in line with the analogy.

**Comparison**
Completion D (forbid) is related to the analogy, but the relationship is not as direct as the one in the analogy. Completion E (permit) is a more direct match for the analogy, as it involves giving permission or authorization, which is similar to the actions of ""give"" and ""take"".

**Completion D: asleep**

1. Completion D relates to the analogy by suggesting that ""awake"" has an opposite, just like ""clean"" has an opposite ""dirty"". In this case, the opposite of ""awake"" is indeed ""asleep"".

**Completion E: alert**

2. Completion E relates to the analogy by suggesting that ""awake"" has a synonym, just like ""clean"" has a synonym ""dirty"". However, ""alert"" is not the opposite of ""awake"", but rather a state of being awake and attentive.

**Comparison**

The analogy is based on opposition, whereas completion E is based on synonymy. The relationship between ""clean"" and ""dirty"" is one of opposition, and the same relationship is expected between ""awake"" and its opposite.

**Conclusion**

Based on the comparison, completion D correctly completes the analogy by suggesting an opposite of ""awake"", whereas completion E does not.

**2. Briefly explain how completion E relates to the analogy.**
Completion E, ""crooked"", also suggests that the analogy is comparing opposites. However, ""crooked"" is not a direct opposite of ""bent"", as ""crooked"" implies a more deliberate or intentional curvature, whereas ""bent"" can be a more neutral or accidental curvature.

**3. Compare the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy.**
Both completions D and E suggest that the analogy is comparing opposites. However, completion D provides a more direct and neutral opposite of ""bent"", whereas completion E provides a more nuanced and intentional opposite.
