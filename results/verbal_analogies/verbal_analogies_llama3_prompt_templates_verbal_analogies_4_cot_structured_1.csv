This relationship is based on the idea that ""aid"" is the opposite of ""help"", and similarly, ""lower"" is the opposite of ""raise"". This completion suggests that the action of ""raising"" something can be replaced with the action of ""lowering"" it.

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy:

Completion D suggests a relationship between ""raise"" and ""lift"" as types of actions, whereas completion E suggests a relationship between ""raise"" and ""lower"" as opposing actions.

2. Completion E: muscular

In this completion, ""hero"" is contrasted with ""coward"", and ""strong"" is contrasted with ""muscular"". This suggests that the analogy is about physical attributes, where ""hero"" and ""strong"" are associated with physical prowess, and ""coward"" and ""muscular"" are not necessarily related.

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy:

Completion D relates to the analogy by providing a contrasting pair, where ""hero"" and ""strong"" are positive opposites of ""coward"" and ""weak"", respectively. This completion maintains the same contrast and opposition as the original analogy.

Completion E, on the other hand, does not provide a clear contrasting pair. ""Muscular"" is not necessarily a contrasting attribute to ""strong"", and the analogy loses its coherence.

2/ Briefly explain how completion E relates to the analogy:
Completion E, ""serene"", relates to the analogy because a teacher is to a student as a serene person is to a stormy person. Just as a teacher provides a sense of stability and guidance to a student, a serene person is often a contrast to a stormy person, implying a sense of peace and tranquility.

3/ Compare the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy:
Both completions D and E present a contrast between the two pairs of words. However, completion D presents a more dramatic contrast, with ""stormy"" implying a sense of turmoil, while completion E presents a more subtle contrast, with ""serene"" implying a sense of peace.

4/ Based on the comparisons, determine which completion (D or E) correctly completes the analogy:
Based on the analogy, which presents a relationship between a teacher and a student, I believe that completion E, ""serene"", is a more fitting completion. The relationship between a teacher and a student is one of guidance and instruction, which is more closely aligned with the idea of a serene person providing a sense of peace and tranquility.
