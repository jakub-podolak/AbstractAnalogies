Synonym,easy,simple,sad,unhappy,happy,"1/ Completion D, ""unhappy,"" relates to the analogy by completing the second half of the analogy ""easy : simple :: sad : unhappy."" This means that just as easy is to simple, sad is to unhappy. In other words, easy and simple are related in that easy is simpler than something else, and sad and unhappy are related in that sad is a feeling that is accompanied by or results in unhappiness.

2/ Completion E, ""happy,"" does not correctly complete the analogy. The analogy states that easy is to simple as sad is to ""?,"" and completion E does not fit this pattern. Easy and simple are related in that easy is a degree of simplicity, while sad and happy are related in that sad is a feeling that is the opposite of happy.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E are different. Completion D correctly completes the analogy by maintaining the pattern of the analogy, which is that easy is to simple as sad is to unhappy. Completion E, on the other hand, does not maintain this pattern and instead introduces a different relationship between sad and happy.

Synonym,hurry,rush,harm,injure,help,"1/ Completion D, ""injure,"" relates to the analogy by completing the second half of the comparison. ""Hurry is to rush"" implies a sense of quickness or haste. ""Harm is to injure"" completes the analogy by implying that just as ""hurry"" causes ""rush,"" ""harm"" causes ""injure."" In other words, causing harm leads to injury.

2/ Completion E, ""help,"" does not correctly relate to the analogy. While ""hurry"" and ""rush"" are related concepts, ""harm"" and ""help"" are not. ""Help"" is the opposite of harm, and the analogy is asking for a term that is similar to ""injure,"" which is the opposite of ""help.""

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E differ significantly. Completion D maintains the analogy's original meaning by completing the comparison with a term that is similar to ""injure."" Completion E, on the other hand, does not maintain the analogy's original meaning and instead introduces an entirely different concept.

Synonym,rob,steal,cry,weep,laugh,"1/ Completion D, ""weep,"" is the correct answer for the analogy ""rob : steal :: cry : ?"". In this analogy, ""rob"" is to ""steal,"" and ""cry"" is to ""weep."" Robbing and stealing both involve taking something from someone without permission. Crying and weeping are both expressions of emotion, with crying being the act and weeping being the result.

2/ Completion E, ""laugh,"" does not correctly complete the analogy. While robbery and stealing are related, crying and laughing are not. Crying is an expression of sadness or emotional pain, while laughing is an expression of happiness or amusement.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E are not comparable to the analogy. Completion D correctly completes the analogy by providing the result or expression of emotion that is analogous to weeping in the context of the analogy. Completion E, on the other hand, does not relate to the analogy at all.

Synonym,polite,courteous,angry,furious,happy,"1/ Completion D, ""D: furious,"" correctly completes the analogy because courteous behavior is often associated with a polite demeanor, and furious behavior is often associated with an angry demeanor. In other words, just as polite behavior is to courteous behavior, angry behavior is to furious behavior.

2/ Completion E, ""E: happy,"" does not correctly complete the analogy because happy is not the opposite of courteous or polite. While someone may be polite or courteous and also happy, happiness is not a direct opposite of politeness or courtesy.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E differ significantly. Completion D accurately reflects the analogy by showing that polite is to courteous as angry is to furious, where each term in the analogy is related to its corresponding term by a relationship of opposition. Completion E, on the other hand, does not accurately reflect the analogy because happy is not the opposite of courteous or polite.

Synonym,beginner,novice,doctor,physician,heal,"1/ Completion D, ""doctor : physician"", completes the analogy by providing the profession that corresponds to the advanced level of expertise in the second pair of terms. A novice is to a beginner as a physician is to a doctor.

2/ Completion E, ""heal : ?"", does not directly complete the analogy as it does not provide a profession or level of expertise that corresponds to the doctor in the analogy.

3/ The relationship presented in completion D is one of professional development, where a doctor is a more advanced and experienced version of a physician. In the analogy, a beginner is to a novice as a doctor is to a physician.

Synonym,baby,infant,woman,lady,girl,"1/ Completion D, ""D: lady"", relates to the analogy by completing the comparison between ""infant"" and ""woman"". In the analogy, ""baby"" is to ""infant"" as ""woman"" is to ""?"". The missing part, ""?"", is completed as ""lady"" in this analogy, as a woman is to a lady as a baby is to an infant.

2/ Completion E, ""E: girl"", also attempts to complete the analogy by comparing ""infant"" to ""girl"" and ""woman"" to ""?"". However, this completion does not correctly fit the analogy as a ""girl"" is not the same as a ""lady"". A girl is a younger female, while a lady is a respectful title for a woman.

3/ Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E, we can see that completion D correctly completes the analogy as it maintains the comparison between the two parts of the analogy. Completion E, on the other hand, does not correctly maintain the comparison as ""girl"" is not the same as ""lady"".

Synonym,brook,stream,courage,bravery,cowardice,"1/ Completion D, ""D: bravery,"" relates to the analogy by suggesting that just as a brook is a type of stream, courage is a type of bravery. In other words, courage is a specific manifestation or aspect of bravery.

2/ Completion E, ""E: cowardice,"" relates to the analogy by suggesting that just as a brook is a type of stream, courage is a type of cowardice. However, this is not a valid completion as courage is not a type of cowardice, but rather an opposite trait.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E differ significantly. Completion D correctly identifies a relationship of part-to-whole or type-to-type, where courage is a specific type of bravery. Completion E, on the other hand, suggests a relationship of opposite or antithesis, where courage is the opposite of cowardice.

Synonym,huge,enormous,wealthy,rich,poor,"1/ Completion D, ""D: rich"", relates to the analogy by suggesting that just as huge is to enormous, wealthy is to rich. In other words, huge and enormous are both extreme forms of size, and wealthy and rich are both extreme forms of having a lot of resources or money.

2/ Completion E, ""E: poor"", relates to the analogy by suggesting that just as huge is to enormous, wealthy is to poor. In this case, the analogy is suggesting a contrast between two extremes, with huge and enormous representing large sizes, and wealthy and poor representing contrasting levels of financial resources.

3/ Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E, we can see that completion D maintains the analogy's original contrast between two extremes, with huge and enormous representing size, and wealthy and rich representing contrasting levels of financial resources. Completion E, on the other hand, reverses the contrast, suggesting that wealthy and poor are similar in some way, rather than contrasting.

4/ Based on the comparisons, completion D correctly completes the analogy, as it maintains the original contrast between two extremes, consistent with the analogy's intended meaning.

Synonym,cheerful,happy,awful,horrible,wonderful,"1/ Completion D, ""D: horrible"", relates to the analogy by completing the comparison between ""cheerful"" and ""awful"". In the analogy, ""cheerful"" is to ""happy"" as ""awful"" is to ""?"". Since ""happy"" is a positive emotion, and ""awful"" is a negative emotion, it follows that ""?"" should also represent a negative emotion. ""Horrible"" is a negative emotion that is often used to describe something that is very unpleasant or disgusting, making it a suitable completion for the analogy.

2/ Completion E, ""E: wonderful"", does not correctly complete the analogy. While ""wonderful"" is a positive emotion, it is not the opposite of ""awful"" in the same way that ""happy"" is the opposite of ""cheerful"". ""Wonderful"" implies something that is amazing or delightful, while ""awful"" implies something that is very bad or unpleasant.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E differ in that completion D maintains the opposite relationship between the emotions described in the analogy, while completion E does not. Completion D correctly completes the analogy by maintaining the opposite relationship between ""cheerful"" and ""awful"", and completing the analogy with a negative emotion, ""horrible"". Completion E, on the other hand, does not maintain the opposite relationship between ""cheerful"" and ""awful"", and instead completes the analogy with a positive emotion, ""wonderful"".

""Start"" is then suggested as the equivalent concept for ""begin"".

2/ Completion E, ""E: continue"", also relates to the analogy by suggesting that ""stay"" is equivalent to ""remain"" in the sense of continuation or persistence. However, ""continue"" is a more specific term than ""start"" and implies that the current state has already been initiated.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E are similar in that they both suggest that ""stay"" is equivalent to ""remain"" and that the concepts related to ""begin"" and ""stay"" are related to the concepts related to ""begin"" and ""continue"" or ""start"" and ""continue"", respectively. However, completion D is more general and does not specify that the current state has already been initiated, while completion E is more specific.

2/ Completion E, ""unknown,"" does not correctly complete the analogy. The analogy compares degrees of recognition or distinction, not degrees of familiarity or obscurity.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E differ significantly. Completion D maintains the comparison of degrees of recognition or distinction, while completion E introduces a comparison of degrees of familiarity or obscurity.

Synonym,sick,ill,little,small,big,"1/ Completion D, ""D: small,"" relates to the analogy by suggesting that just as being sick makes one ill, being little makes one small. In other words, the degree or extent of the quality or state is proportional in both comparisons.

2/ Completion E, ""E: big,"" does not correctly relate to the analogy. The analogy compares degrees or extents of qualities or states, not their opposites.

3/ Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy, we see that completion D aligns with the analogy as it suggests a proportional relationship between the degrees or extents of the qualities or states. Completion E, on the other hand, does not align with the analogy as it suggests an opposite relationship.

Synonym,legal,lawful,usual,normal,strange,"1/ Completion D, ""normal,"" is the correct answer for the analogy ""legal : lawful :: usual : ?"". In this analogy, ""legal"" is to ""lawful"" as ""usual"" is to ""normal"". ""Legal"" and ""lawful"" are related concepts in law, where something that is ""lawful"" is permitted by law, and something that is ""legal"" is in accordance with the law. Similarly, ""usual"" and ""normal"" are related concepts in general usage, where something that is ""usual"" is common or ordinary, and something that is ""normal"" is typical or expected.

2/ Completion E, ""strange,"" does not correctly complete the analogy. While ""strange"" is the opposite of ""normal,"" it does not relate to the analogy in the same way that ""legal"" and ""lawful"" do to ""usual"" and ""normal"".

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E are different. Completion D correctly relates ""legal"" and ""lawful"" to ""usual"" and ""normal"" by showing that they are opposite sides of the same coin, with ""legal"" and ""lawful"" being the permitted or expected side, and ""usual"" and ""normal"" being the common or typical side. Completion E, on the other hand, does not relate to the analogy at all, as ""strange"" is not the opposite of ""usual"" or ""normal"" in the same way that ""legal"" is to ""lawful"".

Synonym,collect,gather,leave,abandon,stay,"1/ Completion D, ""D: abandon,"" relates to the analogy by suggesting that when we collect or gather something, we are essentially taking it from its original location or state, and abandoning it in a new place or context. For example, when we collect coins, we abandon them from their previous circulation and bring them together in a collection.

2/ Completion E, ""E: stay,"" does not fit well with the analogy. While ""leave"" implies separating or removing something, ""stay"" implies keeping something in its current location or state. The analogy suggests a relationship between two pairs of concepts, where the first concept in each pair is related to the second concept in some way. ""Stay"" does not fit this pattern.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E differ significantly. Completion D establishes a relationship of taking and leaving, where the first concept in each pair is related to the act of removing or separating, and the second concept is related to the state or location that is being left or abandoned. Completion E, on the other hand, does not establish a clear relationship between the two pairs of concepts.

2/ Completion E, ""miserable,"" does not correctly relate to the analogy. While being neat is generally considered desirable, being miserable is not a desirable outcome of being unfortunate. The analogy is about similar relationships between pairs, and being miserable is not a suitable match for being fortunate.

3/ Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy, we can see that completion D correctly completes the analogy. Completion D maintains the relationship between the pairs, with clean leading to neat and fortunate leading to lucky. Completion E, on the other hand, does not maintain the relationship, as being miserable is not a desirable outcome of being unfortunate.

2/ Completion E, ""approximate,"" relates to the analogy by suggesting that just as immense is to colossal (both being large and impressive), precise is to something that is approximate or an approximation of something.

3/ In the analogy, ""immense : colossal :: precise : ?"", the first pairing, ""immense : colossal,"" establishes a relationship of size and grandeur. The second pairing, ""precise : ?,"" is asking for a relationship that parallels the relationship of size and grandeur, but in terms of accuracy or measurement.

4/ Completion D, ""exact,"" correctly completes the analogy because it maintains the parallel relationship of size and grandeur with accuracy and measurement. Completion E, ""approximate,"" does not correctly complete the analogy because it suggests a relationship of inaccuracy or imprecision, which is not parallel to the relationship of size and grandeur.

Synonym,help,aid,raise,lift,lower,"1/ Completion D, ""D: lift,"" relates to the analogy as follows: In the given analogy, ""help : aid"" is compared to ""raise : ?"". The words ""help"" and ""aid"" are synonyms, meaning they have similar meanings. ""Help"" means to give assistance or support to someone, while ""aid"" means to give assistance or help. Similarly, ""raise"" means to lift or move something to a higher position, while ""lift"" is a synonym for raising something. Therefore, ""lift"" can be considered the correct completion for the analogy as it maintains the relationship between the two parts of the analogy.

2/ Completion E, ""E: lower,"" does not correctly complete the analogy. The analogy compares ""help : aid"" to ""raise : ?"". ""Help"" and ""aid"" are synonyms, meaning they have similar meanings, and ""raise"" means to lift or move something to a higher position. ""Lower,"" on the other hand, means to move something to a lower position. Therefore, ""lower"" does not maintain the relationship between the two parts of the analogy.

3/ Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy, we can see that completion D, ""D: lift,"" correctly maintains the relationship between the two parts of the analogy. Both ""help"" and ""aid"" are synonyms, and both ""raise"" and ""lift"" are synonyms.

In the context of the analogy, ""rug : carpet,"" a carpet is a large, thick floor covering. ""Bucket : pail"" is a container and its smaller carrying counterpart. So, ""rug : carpet"" is like ""bucket : pail"" in that a rug is a larger covering for a floor, and a pail is a larger container that a bucket is a part of.

2/ Completion E, ""milk,"" does not correctly complete the analogy. The analogy is about containers and their respective sizes, not about the contents of those containers.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E are different. Completion D correctly relates to the analogy by comparing the sizes of the containers (rug and carpet, bucket and pail).

2/ Completion E, ""E: wealthy"", also relates to the analogy by suggesting that just as love is the opposite or strong feeling to hate, rich is the opposite or contrasting condition to a state of being wealthy. However, this completion is less commonly used in this analogy as the term ""wealthy"" is often considered synonymous with ""rich"".

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E are similar in that they both suggest that love and hate are opposite feelings, while rich and poor (or rich and wealthy) are opposite economic conditions.

In other words, ugliness and sorrow are related in that they are opposite or contrasting concepts. Beauty and joy are also opposite or contrasting concepts.

2/ Completion E suggests that ugliness is to beauty like joy is to emotion. In this case, the analogy is saying that just as beauty is a positive emotion or feeling, joy is a positive emotion or feeling. Ugliness and sorrow, on the other hand, could be considered negative emotions or feelings.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E are different. Completion D focuses on the contrast between positive and negative concepts, while completion E focuses on the emotional nature of the concepts.

""Arrive"" can be considered as the opposite of ""depart,"" which is a term used to describe the end of a presence or an event. Therefore, ""depart"" can be considered as the counterpart of ""tiny"" in the analogy, as both represent the beginning or the smaller counterpart of an event or entity.

2/ Explanation for completion E: ""Come"" can also be considered as the opposite of ""arrive,"" as it represents the act of moving towards a place. However, it does not directly relate to the size comparison aspect of the analogy.

Opposite,somber,cheerful,lawyer,client,doctor,"1/ In the given analogy, ""somber"" is to ""cheerful"" as ""lawyer"" is to ""?"". Here, ""somber"" and ""cheerful"" represent two contrasting emotions. Similarly, ""lawyer"" and ""?"" represent two contrasting professions. The missing profession is the one that is often associated with providing advice or representation, just like how ""cheerful"" is the opposite of ""somber"" in terms of emotions. Therefore, the correct answer is ""client"". A lawyer represents a client in a court of law, just as how cheerfulness is the opposite of somberness in terms of emotions.

2/ In this case, ""doctor"" does not correctly complete the analogy. While a doctor is a professional who provides medical care, the relationship between a doctor and a patient is not the same as the relationship between a lawyer and a client. A lawyer provides legal advice and representation, while a doctor provides medical care and treatment. The analogy requires two contrasting professions, each with a corresponding contrasting emotion.

3/ Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E, we can see that completion D correctly completes the analogy. In the analogy, ""lawyer"" is compared to the missing profession based on their roles and relationships with their respective counterparts. Completion D correctly identifies the missing profession as ""client"", as it is the one that hires a lawyer to represent them in legal matters, just as how a person might feel cheerful to balance out the somber emotion.

In this analogy, antonym and synonym are related concepts where an antonym is a word that has the opposite meaning of another word, while a synonym is a word or phrase that has the same or nearly the same meaning as another word. In the context of the analogy, ""selfish"" is the word given for one end of the relationship, and ""generous"" is the word that completes the analogy by being the opposite end of the relationship for the concept of ""unselfishness"" or ""giving to others"".

2/ Completion E, ""egocentric,"" is not the correct answer for the analogy ""antonym : synonym :: selfish : ?"". While ""egocentric"" is related to the concept of self-centeredness, it does not complete the analogy as the opposite of ""selfish"" in the same way that ""generous"" does. ""Egocentric"" refers to a person who is excessively self-centered and focused on their own needs, desires, and interests, while ""selfish"" also implies a disregard for the needs and feelings of others. However, ""generous"" is the opposite of ""selfish"" in the sense of being unselfish, giving, and considerate of others.

3/ Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E, we can see that they differ in their focus. Completion D emphasizes the oppositeness of quiet and noisy, and last and first. Completion E, on the other hand, suggests a more abstract relationship between quiet and noisy, and last and final.

4/ Based on the comparisons, completion D is the correct completion of the analogy. The oppositeness relationship between quiet and noisy, and last and first, aligns more closely with the intended meaning of the analogy.

Opposite,start,stop,trivial,important,famous,"1/ Completion D relates to the analogy by suggesting that ""stop"" is to something that is important in the same way that ""start"" is to something trivial. In other words, just as a start is a beginning that is not essential in and of itself, a stop is an end that is not important in and of itself, but rather marks the end of something that is important.

2/ Completion E suggests that ""stop"" is to something that is famous in the same way that ""start"" is to something trivial. This completion does not fit the analogy, as fame is not the opposite of triviality.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E are quite different. Completion D correctly identifies the relationship between ""start"" and ""stop"" as one of opposites, with ""start"" being the beginning of something and ""stop"" being the end. Completion E, on the other hand, suggests an unrelated relationship between ""start"" and ""stop"" and something famous.

Opposite,laugh,cry,cheap,expensive,inexpensive,"1/ Completion D, ""expensive,"" relates to the analogy by completing the second half of the comparison. ""Cry"" is often associated with sadness or negative emotions, and ""expensive"" is often associated with a high cost or value. In the same way, ""laugh"" is often associated with happiness or positive emotions, and ""cheap"" is often associated with a low cost or value.

2/ Completion E, ""inexpensive,"" also relates to the analogy by completing the second half of the comparison. However, it does so in the opposite way. ""Cry"" is often associated with sadness or negative emotions, and ""inexpensive"" is often associated with a low cost or value. In the same way, ""laugh"" is often associated with happiness or positive emotions, and ""cheap"" is often associated with a low cost or value.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E are similar in that they both complete the analogy by comparing the costs or values of ""laugh"" and ""cry"" to those of ""cheap"" and ""expensive"" or ""inexpensive."" However, completion D completes the analogy by comparing the costs or values in a way that reinforces the emotional associations of the words, while completion E completes the analogy in a way that contradicts the emotional associations of the words.

4/ Based on the comparisons, completion D correctly completes the analogy because it reinforces the emotional associations of the words in the analogy.

In other words, just as ""accept"" is the opposite or counterpart of ""reject"", ""dark"" is the opposite or counterpart of ""bright"".

2/ Completion E, ""E: dim"", also relates to the analogy but in a different way. It suggests that the relationship between ""accept"" and ""reject"" is similar to the relationship between ""dark"" and ""dim"". In this case, ""accept"" and ""dark"" could be considered as having some common property or characteristic, while ""reject"" and ""dim"" also share a similarity.

3/ Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E, we can see that while both completions maintain the ""is to"" relationship between the pairs, they propose different analogies. Completion D suggests a simple opposition or counterpart relationship, while completion E introduces an additional layer of similarity between the pairs.

4/ Based on the comparisons, completion D is the more straightforward and accurate completion of the analogy. The opposition or counterpart relationship between ""accept"" and ""reject"" is more directly analogous to the opposition or counterpart relationship between ""dark"" and ""bright"".

2/ Completion E, ""E: muscular"", relates to the analogy by suggesting that a coward is to a hero as muscular is to strong. In this case, the analogy is implying that a hero is strong and muscular, while a coward is not as strong or muscular.

3/ Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E, we can see that both completions relate to the analogy by describing the relationship between a hero and a coward in terms of strength. However, completion D focuses on the lack of strength in a coward, while completion E expands on the idea of strength by introducing the concept of muscularity.

4/ Based on the comparisons, completion D more accurately completes the analogy because it directly addresses the relationship between a hero and a coward in terms of strength, which is the central idea of the analogy. Completion E, while related, introduces an additional concept (muscularity) that is not explicitly stated in the analogy.

2/ Completion E relates to the analogy as follows: In the given analogy, ""give"" is related to ""take"" as ""allow"" is related to ""permit"". So, ""permit"" can also be considered as a possible completion for the analogy, but it does not correctly complete it.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy are as follows:
- Completion D: ""give"" is to ""take"" as ""allow"" is to ""forbid""
- Completion E: ""give"" is to ""take"" as ""allow"" is to ""permit""

The difference between the two completions lies in the meaning of the missing term. ""Forbid"" and ""permit"" have opposite meanings. ""Forbid"" means to prohibit or deny, while ""permit"" means to allow or authorize.

4/ Based on the comparisons, completion D correctly completes the analogy because it maintains the opposite meanings of the terms in the analogy. Completion E does not correctly complete the analogy because it introduces a term with the same meaning as ""allow"".

2/ Completion E, ""alert,"" does not correctly complete the analogy. While alertness can be related to being awake, it does not complete the analogy as intended.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E differ in their completeness to the analogy. Completion D directly completes the analogy by maintaining the parallelism between the pairs ""clean-dirty"" and ""awake-asleep.""

Opposite,remember,forget,increase,decrease,lengthen,"1/ Completion D, ""decrease,"" relates to the analogy by suggesting that the relationship between ""forget"" and ""remember"" is similar to the relationship between ""decrease"" and ""increase."" In other words, just as remembering something involves a decrease in the degree of forgetting it, an increase in knowledge involves a decrease in ignorance.

2/ Completion E, ""lengthen,"" suggests that the relationship between ""forget"" and ""remember"" is similar to the relationship between ""shorten"" and ""lengthen."" In this case, remembering something could be seen as lengthening the duration or extent of our awareness or knowledge of it, while forgetting involves a shortening of that awareness or knowledge.

3/ Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy, we can see that both completions capture aspects of the relationship between ""remember"" and ""forget,"" but they do so in different ways. Completion D emphasizes the idea of opposites or complements, suggesting that remembering and forgetting are two sides of the same coin. Completion E, on the other hand, emphasizes the idea of duration or extent, suggesting that remembering involves a lengthening or expansion of our awareness or knowledge.

4/ Based on the comparisons, completion D more accurately completes the analogy because it captures the essential idea of opposites or complements that is present in the relationship between ""remember"" and ""forget."" While completion E is an interesting alternative, it does not capture the same essential relationship between the two concepts.

2/ Completion E, ""E: crooked,"" also relates to the analogy but in a slightly different way. Here, crazy and bent are again opposite extremes, but sane and crooked are the normal or balanced states.

3/ Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E, we can see that both completions maintain the analogy's original structure, with crazy and bent being opposites, and sane or straight (and its respective opposite) representing more normal or balanced states. However, the difference lies in which state is considered the ""normal"" or ""balanced"" state for sane and bent.

In the context of the analogy, ""house"" is built on a ""foundation,"" which can be thought of as a hole in the ground. Therefore, ""house"" is to ""foundation"" (a hole in the ground) as ""build"" is to ""dig.""

2/ Completion E suggests that ""dig"" is an action that uses a ""shovel."" While a shovel is a tool used in the digging process, it is not the end result of the action. In the context of the analogy, ""house"" is built using various materials and actions, including digging a foundation. However, the foundation itself is not a shovel. Therefore, ""house"" is not to ""shovel"" as ""build"" is to ""dig.""

3/ The relationship presented in completion D correctly completes the analogy by identifying the end result of the action ""dig,"" which is a ""hole."" In contrast, completion E does not correctly complete the analogy as it suggests a tool used in the digging process rather than the end result.

3/ The relationship presented in completion D is that of an organ or body part enabling a function (hearing) and an object used in connection with that function (clothes). In contrast, completion E presents a relationship between a group of people (women) and an object (clothes), which is not directly related to the given analogy.

2/ Completion E, ""frog,"" is not a correct answer for the analogy as cabbage and frog do not share the same characteristics. While cabbage is an edible vegetable, a frog is an edible animal but not a vegetable.

3/ In the analogy, ""vegetable : cabbage :: insect : ?"", the first pair, ""vegetable : cabbage,"" represents a specific type of vegetable, while the second pair, ""insect : ?,"" represents a specific type of animal. The correct answer, ""beetle,"" completes the analogy by representing an edible insect, making the analogy ""vegetable : cabbage :: insect : beetle"" a valid comparison.

4/ The comparison between the two completions, D and E, shows that only completion D correctly completes the analogy as it maintains the relationship between the first and second pairs in the analogy. Completion E does not fit the analogy as it does not represent an edible insect.

Category Members,insect,bee,fish,halibut,water,"1/ Completion D, ""halibut,"" relates to the analogy by completing the comparison between insects and bees, and fish. Insects are to bees as fish are to halibut, meaning that bees are a specific type of insect, just as halibut is a specific type of fish.

2/ Completion E, ""water,"" does not correctly relate to the analogy. The analogy is comparing insects to bees and fish to a specific type of fish, not insects to water and bees to water or fish to water.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E are different. Completion D maintains the analogy by comparing insects and bees to fish and a specific type of fish. Completion E does not maintain the analogy as it compares insects to water and bees to water or fish to water, which is not the intended comparison.

4/ Based on the comparisons, completion D correctly completes the analogy.

Category Members,flower,rose,bird,pigeon,nest,"1/ Completion D, ""pigeon,"" relates to the analogy by completing the comparison between ""rose"" and ""bird."" In this context, ""rose"" is a specific type of flower, and ""bird"" is a specific type of animal. ""Pigeon"" is a specific type of bird, making it a suitable completion for ""D.""

2/ Completion E, ""nest,"" does not correctly relate to the analogy. The analogy compares ""flower"" to ""rose"" and ""bird"" to an unknown, so ""nest"" does not fit the comparison.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E differ significantly. Completion D maintains the comparison between ""flower"" and ""rose"" and extends it to ""bird"" and ""pigeon,"" making it a valid completion. Completion E, ""nest,"" does not relate to the comparison at all and is not a valid completion.

Category Members,bird,wren,insect,mosquito,sting,"1/ Completion D, ""mosquito,"" relates to the analogy as the specific example of an insect that is often compared to a wren as a specific example of a bird. Birds and wrens are both animals that have the ability to fly and sing, and mosquitoes and wrens are both small creatures that are common in their respective environments.

2/ Completion E, ""sting,"" does not directly relate to the analogy as it is not an animal or insect, but rather an action or characteristic. However, it could be argued that birds and wrens have a ""sting"" in the sense that they can defend themselves or their young, but this is a less direct comparison.

3/ The relationship presented in completion D is a direct comparison of specific examples in their respective categories, while completion E presents a less direct comparison of a characteristic or action.

4/ Based on the comparisons, completion D correctly completes the analogy as it presents a direct comparison of specific examples in their respective categories, following the structure of the analogy ""bird : wren :: insect : ?""

Category Members,vegetable,lettuce,bird,sparrow,cat,"1/ Explanation for completion D: In the given analogy, ""vegetable : lettuce"" represents the first part, which is a type of relationship between a category (vegetable) and a specific example (lettuce). The second part of the analogy, ""bird : ?"", is asking for a specific type of bird that completes the analogy with the lettuce. The answer is ""sparrow"". Sparrows are often used as an example of birds that eat lettuce or other vegetables.

2/ Explanation for completion E: In this case, the analogy is incorrectly completed with ""cat"" instead of a bird species. Cats are not related to lettuce in the same way that vegetables are related to lettuce or birds are related to sparrows.

3/ Comparison of relationships: The correct completion, D, relates to the analogy by maintaining the consistency of the relationship between the categories and their specific examples. In this case, vegetables and lettuce are related as a category and a specific example, and birds and sparrows are also related as a category and a specific example.

Category Members,sport,soccer,vehicle,bus,engine,"1/ Completion D, ""D: bus"", relates to the analogy by completing the comparison between soccer and a vehicle. In this context, soccer is the activity or game, and a bus is a large vehicle that transports a group of people. The analogy suggests that soccer is to a sport as a bus is to a vehicle, implying that soccer is a specific type of sport, just as a bus is a specific type of vehicle.

2/ Completion E, ""E: engine"", does not correctly relate to the analogy. While soccer and a vehicle can both have engines (soccer fields have engines to maintain the grass, and vehicles have engines to function), the analogy does not suggest that engines are the missing comparison. The analogy is comparing soccer to a vehicle as two distinct entities, not as having a common engine.

3/ Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy, we can see that completion D correctly completes the analogy. Completion D maintains the comparison between soccer and a vehicle as two distinct entities, with soccer being a specific type of sport, and a bus being a specific type of vehicle. Completion E, on the other hand, introduces an unrelated concept, as engines are not the missing comparison in the analogy.

4/ Based on the comparisons, the correct completion of the analogy is D: bus.

2/ Completion E, ""E: cotton,"" does not directly relate to the analogy as cotton is a material used for clothing, but it does not complete the analogy as ""pistol"" has no direct relation to ""cotton.""

3/ The relationship presented in completion D is that of a specific type of weapon (pistol) to a category of items (weapons), and the relationship presented in completion D is that of a specific type of clothing (shoes) to a category of items (clothing). In the analogy, pistols and weapons share a common characteristic, and shoes and clothing share a common characteristic.

Category Members,sport,tennis,weapon,gun,murder,"1/ Completion D, ""gun,"" is a correct completion of the analogy as tennis and gun are both associated with sports and weapons, respectively. Tennis is a sport played with equipment, including rackets and balls, while a gun is a weapon used for hunting or protection. Both tennis and guns have specific uses and functions within their respective domains.

2/ Completion E, ""murder,"" does not correctly complete the analogy as there is no direct relationship between tennis and murder. Tennis is a sport, while murder is an act of violence. Although weapons can be used in the commission of a murder, the analogy does not imply that the relationship between tennis and murder is the same as that between sport and weapon.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E differ significantly. Completion D, ""gun,"" correctly completes the analogy by establishing a parallel relationship between tennis and the weapon, gun. Both tennis and gun have specific uses and functions within their respective domains. Completion E, ""murder,"" does not correctly complete the analogy as there is no direct relationship between tennis and murder.

4/ Based on the comparisons, completion D is the correct answer as it correctly completes the analogy by establishing a parallel relationship between tennis and the weapon, gun.

Category Members,furniture,sofa,sport,golf,coat,"1/ Explanation for completion D: In the given analogy, furniture is compared to a sofa, and sport is compared to an unspecified term. Completion D suggests that golf is the missing term for the sport side of the analogy. This completion is correct because golf is a type of sport, just as a sofa is a type of furniture.

2/ Explanation for completion E: Completion E suggests that a coat is the missing term for the analogy. However, this completion is incorrect because a coat is not a type of sport. Instead, it is a type of clothing, which is not related to the given analogy.

3/ Comparison of relationships: The correct completion D establishes a relationship between furniture and sofas, as well as between sports and golf. Both sides of the analogy involve a general category (furniture and sports) and a specific type within that category (sofa and golf). Completion E, on the other hand, does not establish a valid relationship between furniture and coats, as they belong to different categories.

4/ Determination: Based on the comparisons, completion D correctly completes the analogy as it establishes a valid relationship between furniture and sofas, as well as between sports and golf.

Category Members,tool,pliers,vehicle,van,fuel,"1/ Completion D, ""D: van"", relates to the analogy by completing the comparison between ""tool"" and ""vehicle"". In this context, ""pliers"" is a type of tool, and a ""van"" is a type of vehicle. Both are used to transport or manipulate things, but a van can transport larger loads and more people than pliers can manipulate.

2/ Completion E, ""E: fuel"", does not correctly complete the analogy. While pliers and vehicles both require some form of energy to function, fuel is not an appropriate completion for the analogy because it does not share the same relationship with ""vehicle"" as ""van"" shares with ""tool"".

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E differ significantly. Completion D establishes a relationship between two things that are both types of their respective categories (tool and vehicle) and shares a common function (transporting or manipulating). Completion E, on the other hand, establishes a relationship between a tool (pliers) and a necessary resource (fuel) for its operation, but it does not share the same function or category with the other terms in the analogy.

4/ Based on the comparisons, completion D correctly completes the analogy because it shares the same relationship with the other terms in the analogy. Both pliers and a van are tools or instruments used for specific purposes, and the comparison highlights their similarities and differences in terms of their functions and capabilities.

Category Members,clothing,trousers,fish,cod,net,"1/ Explanation for completion D: In the given analogy, clothing is compared to trousers, and fish is the missing term. The correct completion for the analogy would be ""fish : cod"". This is because cod is a type of fish, just as trousers are a type of clothing.

2/ Explanation for completion E: In this completion, the analogy is completed as ""clothing : trousers :: fish : net"". However, this is not a valid completion as a net is not a type of fish but rather a tool used for catching fish.

3/ Comparison of relationships: The correct completion D establishes a relationship between clothing and trousers, and between fish and cod, where each term in the analogy is related to its corresponding term through the concept of a type. Completion E, on the other hand, does not establish a valid relationship as a net is not a type of fish.

Category Members,fruit,banana,furniture,dresser,house,"1/ Completion D, ""dresser,"" relates to the analogy by completing the analogy with a specific type of furniture, just as ""banana"" completes the analogy with a specific type of fruit. A dresser is to furniture what a banana is to fruit.

2/ Completion E, ""house,"" does not correctly complete the analogy. A house is a larger structure that can contain multiple pieces of furniture, whereas a banana is a single fruit. The analogy requires two things of the same type, with one being a specific example of the other.

3/ The relationships presented in completions D and E differ in that completion D correctly maintains the analogy by completing it with a specific type of furniture, while completion E does not maintain the analogy by introducing a larger, non-specific type of structure.

Category Members,fish,shark,sport,baseball,team,"1/ Explanation for completion D: In the given analogy, ""fish : shark"" represents a relationship where ""fish"" is a more general category and ""shark"" is a specific type of fish. ""Sport : baseball"" is another relationship where ""sport"" is a more general category and ""baseball"" is a specific type of sport. Therefore, completion D, ""baseball"", fits the analogy as it represents a specific type of sport.

2/ Explanation for completion E: In the given analogy, ""fish : shark"" represents a relationship where ""fish"" is a more general category and ""shark"" is a specific type of fish. ""Sport : team"" is a different relationship where ""sport"" is a more general category and ""team"" is a group of people who participate in that sport. Therefore, completion E, ""team"", does not fit the analogy as it does not represent a specific type of sport.

3/ Comparison of relationships in completions D and E: Completion D, ""baseball"", represents a specific type of sport, while completion E, ""team"", represents a group of people who participate in a sport. These relationships are not directly comparable to the given analogy as they represent different aspects of the sport world.

Category Members,flower,carnation,tool,hacksaw,carpenter,"1/ Completion D relates to the analogy by suggesting that a carnation is to a flower as a hacksaw is to a tool. In this context, a carnation is a specific type of flower, and a hacksaw is a specific type of tool. Both are instances of their respective categories.

2/ Completion E suggests that a carnation is to a flower as a carpenter is to a tool. In this context, a carpenter is a person who uses tools, and a carnation is a specific type of flower. This analogy is not as straightforward as completion D, as it introduces the concept of a person using a tool, rather than a tool being a specific type of tool.

3/ Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E, we can see that completion D is a more direct analogy, as it compares two specific instances of their respective categories. Completion E, on the other hand, introduces an additional layer of abstraction by including a person using a tool. While this analogy may be valid, it is not as straightforward as completion D.
