Synonym,easy,simple,sad,unhappy,happy,"The analogy ""A : B :: C : D"" means that the relationship between A and B is the same as the relationship between C and D. In this case, we have ""easy : simple :: sad : ?"".

The first two terms, ""easy"" and ""simple"", are related in the sense that something that is easy to do is also often simple. For example, solving a math problem that is easy might only require a few simple steps.

The second pair of terms, ""simple"" and ""sad"", are related in the sense that something that is simple can sometimes evoke sadness. For example, a simple melody might bring tears to one's eyes.

However, it's not immediately clear what emotion is associated with the term ""easy"". It's possible that something that is easy could also be associated with happiness, as in the phrase ""it's easy being green"" from the song ""The Rainbow Connection"".

But based on the given analogy, the correct answer is:

<ans> D: unhappy </ans>

The reason is that the emotion associated with ""sad"" is opposite to the emotion associated with ""happy"", which is typically considered to be the positive emotion. Therefore, the emotion associated with ""easy"" must be the opposite of the emotion associated with ""sad"", which is ""unhappy"".</s>",,D
Synonym,hurry,rush,harm,injure,help,"The analogy ""hurry : rush :: harm : ?"" means that the relationship between ""hurry"" and ""rush"" is the same as the relationship between ""harm"" and the missing term ""?"".

The relationship between ""hurry"" and ""rush"" is one of synonymy or near-synonymy - they both mean a sense of urgency or haste.

The relationship between ""harm"" and the missing term should also be one of synonymy or near-synonymy. The term that fits this relationship is ""injure"". Therefore, the final answer is:

<ans> D </ans>

So, ""harm : injure"" is an analogy like ""hurry : rush"".</s>",,D
Synonym,rob,steal,cry,weep,laugh,"The analogy ""rob : steal :: cry :?"" means that ""rob is to steal"" is equivalent to ""cry is to?"". In other words, stealing is to rob as weeping is to something.

Synonym,beginner,novice,doctor,physician,heal,"The analogy ""A : B :: C : D"" means that the relationship between A and B is the same as the relationship between C and D.

In the given analogy, we have:

beginner : novice :: doctor : ?

We know that:

beginner is to novice as doctor is to ?

This means that the relationship between beginner and novice is the same as the relationship between doctor and the unknown term.

Now, let's think about what the relationships could be:

beginner is a person who is just starting to learn something, and novice is a person who has more experience and knowledge than a beginner but is still not an expert.

doctor is a person who has completed medical school and is licensed to practice medicine.

So, the relationship between beginner and novice is that of a learner and a more experienced learner. The relationship between doctor and the unknown term should be the same.

Therefore, the unknown term must be a person who has completed their training and is an expert in their field.

The term ""physician"" is a synonym for ""doctor,"" so the answer is:

<ans> D </ans>

Alternatively, we could say that the relationship between beginner and novice is like the relationship between a student and an apprentice, and the relationship between doctor and D is like the relationship between a master and a master. However, ""master"" is not a good fit for the term D in this context, so we prefer the simpler answer ""doctor.""</s>",,D
Synonym,baby,infant,woman,lady,girl,"A baby is to an infant, and a woman is to a lady. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The analogy ""A : B :: C : D"" means that A is to B as C is to D. In this case, a baby is to an infant, and a woman is to a lady. Since a woman is a grown-up female, and a lady is also a grown-up female, the correct answer is D: lady.</s>",,D
Synonym,brook,stream,courage,bravery,cowardice,"The analogy ""brook : stream :: courage : ?"" means that a brook is to a stream as courage is to something. In other words, a brook is a kind of stream, and courage is related to something in the same way.

A brook is a small, flowing body of water that is part of a larger stream or river. Courage is a quality of mind or spirit that enables a person to face difficulty, danger, or pain with calmness and resolution.

A stream is a continuous flow of water, and it can be large or small. Bravery is the quality of being brave, which means facing danger or difficulty with courage and fearlessness.

Therefore, the correct analogy is:

<ans> D: bravery </ans>

Explanation: A brook is a small stream, and courage is a kind of bravery.</s>",,D
Synonym,huge,enormous,wealthy,rich,poor,"The analogy ""huge : enormous :: wealthy : ?"" means that ""huge is to enormous"" has the same relationship as ""wealthy is to ?"". In other words, ""enormous"" is to ""huge"" as ""?"" is to ""wealthy"".

The correct answer is:

<ans> D: rich </ans>

Explanation:

Since ""enormous"" is related to ""huge"" as ""rich"" is related to ""wealthy"", the missing term must be ""rich"". Therefore, the correct analogy is ""huge : enormous :: wealthy : rich"".</s>",,D
Synonym,cheerful,happy,awful,horrible,wonderful,"The analogy ""cheerful : happy :: awful :?"" means that ""cheerful is to happy"" has the same relationship as ""awful is to?"".

We know that ""cheerful is to happy"" can be expressed as ""happiness is to a degree greater than or equal to cheerfulness"".

So, we need to find the term that, when paired with ""awful"", completes the analogy such that ""awfulness is to a degree greater than or equal to that term"".

The term that fits this description is ""horrible"". Therefore, the answer is:

<ans> D: horrible </ans></s>",,D
Synonym,remain,stay,begin,start,continue,"The analogy ""A : B :: C : D"" means that the relationship between A and B is the same as the relationship between C and D. In the given example, we have ""remain : stay :: begin : ?"".

The first two terms, ""remain"" and ""stay"", suggest a continuation or persistence of some state or condition. A possible analogy for the second pair, ""begin"" and ""?"", could be ""start"". However, ""start"" might not be the best fit, as it implies an initial action or the beginning of a process, while ""remain"" and ""stay"" suggest a continuation or persistence.

Another possible analogy for the second pair could be ""continue"". This term fits better with the idea of continuation or persistence, which is suggested by ""remain"" and ""stay"".

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> D: continue </ans>

Explanation: The relationship between ""remain"" and ""stay"" is one of continuation or persistence, and the relationship between ""begin"" and ""continue"" is also one of continuation or persistence. Therefore, the correct analogy is ""remain : stay :: begin : continue"".</s>",,D
Synonym,unusual,strange,famous,renowned,unknown,"The analogy ""A : B :: C : D"" means that the relationship between A and B is the same as the relationship between C and D. In this case, we have ""unusual : strange :: famous : ?"".

The first pair, ""unusual : strange"", suggests a relationship of similarity or likeness. Unusual and strange are both descriptions of things that deviate from the norm or are not typical.

The second pair, ""famous : ?"", suggests a relationship of comparison in terms of reputation or recognition. Famous means well-known or renowned, so the missing term should be a description of something that is not well-known or unknown.

Therefore, the answer is:

<ans> E </ans>

So, the final analogy should be read as ""unusual is to strange as famous is to unknown"".</s>",,E
Synonym,sick,ill,little,small,big,"The analogy ""sick : ill :: little : ?"" means that the relationship between ""sick"" and ""ill"" is the same as the relationship between ""little"" and the missing term ""?"".

The relationship between ""sick"" and ""ill"" is that of synonyms or near-synonyms, meaning that they both refer to a state of not feeling well.

The relationship between ""little"" and ""?"" should also be synonymous or near-synonymous. Therefore, the missing term ""?"" should refer to something that is small in size or quantity.

Hence, the answer is:

<ans> D </ans>

Explanation: The correct answer is ""D: small"" because the relationship between ""little"" and ""small"" is that of synonyms or near-synonyms, meaning that they both refer to something that is of a small size or quantity.</s>",,D
Synonym,legal,lawful,usual,normal,strange,"The analogy ""A : B :: C : D"" means that the relationship between A and B is the same as the relationship between C and D. In this case, we have ""legal : lawful :: usual : ?"".

The first two terms, ""legal"" and ""lawful"", are related in the sense that something that is lawful is something that is in accordance with the law. Similarly, something that is legal is something that is permitted by law.

The next two terms, ""usual"" and ""?"", are related in what way? Let's consider some possibilities:

* If ""?"" represents ""normal"", then the analogy would be ""legal : lawful :: usual : normal"". This is a valid analogy because something that is usual is something that is commonly done or occurs regularly. Similarly, something that is legal is something that is permitted by law, and something that is lawful is something that is in accordance with the law.
* If ""?"" represents ""strange"", then the analogy would be ""legal : lawful :: usual : strange"". This is not a valid analogy because something that is usual is the opposite of strange – it is common or normal, not strange.

Therefore, the correct answer is: <ans> D </ans>

So, the final analogy is ""legal : lawful :: usual : normal"".</s>",,D
Synonym,collect,gather,leave,abandon,stay,"The analogy ""A : B :: C : D"" means that the relationship between A and B is the same as the relationship between C and D. In the given example, we have ""collect : gather :: leave : ?"".

The first two terms, ""collect"" and ""gather"", can be thought of as processes that bring things together. For example, ""collect"" could refer to gathering items, and ""gather"" could refer to bringing a group of people together.

The third term, ""leave"", can be thought of as a process that separates things. For example, it could refer to leaving a place or leaving a group of people.

Therefore, the correct analogy for the question mark would be something that is opposite to ""leave"". That is, it would be a process that keeps things together or doesn't allow things to be separated.

Synonym,clean,neat,fortunate,lucky,miserable,"The analogy ""neat : clean :: fortunate :?"" suggests that the relationship between ""neat"" and ""clean"" is the same as the relationship between ""fortune"" and the missing term ""?"".

The relationship between ""neat"" and ""clean"" is that of a state or condition to the action that achieves it. ""Clean"" is the action that results in the state of being ""neat"".

Similarly, the relationship between ""fortune"" and the missing term ""?"" should be the same. Therefore, the missing term should represent a state or condition that can be achieved by the action of being ""fortunate"".

The term ""lucky"" is a state or condition that can be achieved by being fortunate. Therefore, the answer is:

<ans> D: lucky </ans></s>",,D
Synonym,immense,colossal,precise,exact,approximate,"The analogy ""A : B :: C : D"" means that the relationship between A and B is the same as the relationship between C and D. In other words, A is to B as C is to D.

In the given analogy, we have ""immediate : colossal :: precise : ?"". We need to find the value of the question mark such that the relationship between ""immediate"" and ""colossal"" is the same as the relationship between ""precise"" and the missing term.

The term ""colossal"" suggests something very large or immense. The term ""immediate"" suggests something that happens right away or without delay.

The term ""precise"" suggests something that is exact or accurate.

Therefore, the missing term should be something that is approximate or inexact, as the relationship between ""immediate"" and ""colossal"" is not the same as the relationship between ""precise"" and exact.

So, the answer is:

<ans> E </ans>

or, in English:

The missing term is ""approximate"".</s>",,E
Synonym,stone,rock,garbage,trash,bag,"A stone is to a rock, and garbage is to D. This means that a stone is a type of rock, and garbage is a type of D. We know that a stone is not a type of trash or bag, so D cannot be ""trash"" or ""bag"". The only other common analogy for garbage is ""trash"", but since we've already ruled that out, the answer must be something else.

Let's consider other possible meanings of the term ""D"". One possibility is that ""D"" represents a container or receptacle for garbage, such as a trash can or a dumpster. In this case, the analogy would be ""A stone is to a rock, and garbage is to a container for garbage"". This fits the pattern of the analogy, and it's a valid answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is: <ans> E: container for garbage </ans> or <ans> E: dumpster </ans> or <ans> E: trash can </ans>

A container is a general term that includes both buckets and carpets (rugs). However, since the question asks for a specific answer, the best option is ""D: container"" or ""D: something that can hold or contain things."" But for the sake of completeness, the answer that fits the analogy perfectly is ""D: bucket.""

Therefore, the final answer is: <ans> D: bucket </ans>

However, if we consider the analogy more broadly, the answer could be ""D: container"" or ""D: something that can be used to cover or protect a surface, like a rug or a carpet."" In that case, the answer would be: <ans> D: container or covering </ans>

Opposite,alive,dead,succeed,fail,conquer,"The analogy ""alive : dead :: succeed : ?"" means that being alive is to being dead as succeeding is to some concept X. In other words, just as being alive is the opposite of being dead, succeeding is the opposite of some concept X.

The options provided are ""fail"" and ""conquer"". Let's consider each one:

Option 1: fail

Being alive is the opposite of being dead, so failing would not be the opposite of succeeding. Being alive and succeeding are both positive states, while failing is a negative state.

Option 2: conquer

Being alive is the opposite of being dead, so conquering could be the opposite of failing. In other words, just as being alive is the opposite of being dead, conquering is the opposite of failing to achieve something.

The first pair, ""ugliness"" and ""beauty,"" are opposites. Ugliness is the absence or opposite of beauty.

The second pair, ""joy"" and the unknown concept, are also related but not necessarily opposites. Joy is a positive emotion, and the unknown concept could be another emotion, such as sorrow or sadness, which is a negative emotion.

Given the context, it is reasonable to assume that ""huge"" and ""tiny"" are related to size or quantity, while ""arrive"" and the unknown event ""?"" are related to time.

Therefore, the correct analogy would be ""huge is to tiny, just like arrive is to depart"". This means that just as huge is larger than tiny, depart is an event that occurs before arrive.

Opposite,quiet,noisy,last,first,final,"The analogy ""quiet : noisy :: last : ?"" means that the relationship between quiet and noisy is the same as the relationship between last and the missing term.

Quiet and noisy are types of sound levels. Quiet is a lower sound level, and noisy is a higher sound level.

Last and the missing term are positions in a sequence. Last refers to the final position in a sequence.

So, the missing term should be the first position in the sequence, as the first position is the opposite of the last position in terms of sequence position.

Therefore, the answer is:

Explanation:

The analogy ""A : B :: C : D"" means that A is to B as C is to D. In other words, the relationship between A and B is the same as the relationship between C and D.

In the given analogy ""quiet : noisy :: last : ?"", quiet and noisy are sound levels, and last is a position in a sequence. The missing term should be another position in the sequence, such as the first position.

The first pair, ""start : stop"", represents the beginning and end of a process or event. ""Start"" is the initial point, and ""stop"" is the final point.

The second pair, ""trivial : ?"" is incomplete, and we need to determine the analogy for it based on the given information.

To find the correct analogy for ""trivial : ?"", we need to consider what ""trivial"" represents in the context of the first pair. ""Trivial"" is used to describe something that is simple, unimportant, or easy to understand. In the context of the first pair, ""trivial"" could be seen as the opposite of ""stop"", which is the final point or end of something.

Since ""laugh"" and ""cry"" are related as emotions, we can infer that the missing term ""?"" is also related to emotions.

The opposite of an emotion is often described as the absence or suppression of that emotion. Therefore, the missing term ""?"" could be described as the opposite of emotions, which are feelings of happiness or joy.

The opposite of happiness or joy is sadness or misery. However, the term ""expensive"" is not related to emotions at all. Instead, the opposite of ""cheap"" is ""expensive"". Therefore, the missing term ""?"" should be ""inexpensive"".

The first two terms, ""accept"" and ""reject"", are opposites. Therefore, we need to find two concepts that are opposites and have the same relationship to ""dark"" and the unknown term.

The opposite of ""dark"" is ""light"". However, we cannot use ""light"" as the answer because ""light"" is not an opposite of ""reject"". Instead, we need to find a term that is an opposite of ""reject"" and has the same relationship to ""dark"" as ""light"" does.

The opposite of ""reject"" is ""accept"". Therefore, the correct answer is:

However, the question asks for the unknown term to be ""D"" or ""E"", so the final answer should be:

Opposite,remember,forget,increase,decrease,lengthen,"The analogy ""A : B :: C : D"" means that the relationship between A and B is the same as the relationship between C and D. In other words, A and B are related in the same way that C and D are.

In the given example, we have the functions `remember`, `forget`, `increase`, and the question mark `?`. We are asked to fill in the blank with the correct analogy.

Let's consider the functions one by one:

1. `remember`: This function presumably takes some input and stores it for later use.
2. `forget`: This function presumably takes some input and removes it from memory.
3. `increase`: This function presumably takes some input and returns a new value that is greater than the original input.
4. `?`: We don't know what this function does.

Now let's think about which function could be analogous to `decrease`:

* `remember` and `forget` are related in that they both deal with memory, but they have opposite effects. `remember` adds something to memory, while `forget` removes something. However, neither of them directly decreases anything.
* `increase` directly increases its input, so it doesn't have an inverse relationship with decreasing anything.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> D: decrease </ans>

This means that there must be some other function in the context that is analogous to `increase` and has an inverse relationship with `decrease`. Without more context, it's impossible to determine what that function is.

Alternatively, if the correct answer was supposed to be `E: lengthen`, then the analogy would be:

To complete the analogy, we need to find the answer for the question mark that makes the analogy true.

The answer is ""hole."" The reason is that building a house is an action that results in a house, and digging is an action that results in a hole. So, the correct analogy is ""build : house :: dig : hole.""

Function,sing,song,ride,horse,rider,"In the given analogy ""sing : song :: ride : ?"", we have two pairs of related concepts: ""sing"" and ""song"", and ""ride"" and the unknown term. The analogy suggests that the relationship between ""sing"" and ""song"" is the same as the relationship between ""ride"" and the unknown term.

Let's examine the given pairs:

1. Singing is an activity that produces music, and a song is a composition of words and melody that can be sung.
2. Riding is an activity where someone is on a vehicle, and a horse is a large, four-legged animal that can be ridden.

From this analysis, we can see that the relationship between ""sing"" and ""song"" is that of an activity to its product. Similarly, the relationship between ""ride"" and the unknown term should also be an activity to its product.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> D: horse </ans>

Explanation:
The unknown term should be the product of the activity ""ride"", which is a horse.</s>",,D
Function,hear,ear,wear,clothes,woman,"The analogy ""A : B :: C : D"" means that ""A is related to B in the same way that C is related to D.""

In the given analogy ""hear : ear :: wear : ?"", we have two pairs of related items:

1. hear : ear
2. wear : ?

The first pair tells us that ""hear"" is related to ""ear"" in the same way that something is related to ""ear"" in the second pair.

The word ""ear"" is related to the sense of hearing. Therefore, the missing term in the analogy should be related to clothing or the act of wearing clothes.

However, the term ""woman"" is not related to clothing or the act of wearing clothes. So, the answer is:

Function,drive,car,burn,wood,fire,"The analogy ""drive : car :: burn : ?"" suggests that driving is to cars what burning is to something. In the given context, the missing part is a substance that gets consumed during the process of burning.

The correct analogy would be:

D: fuel

However, in the given options, the correct answer is:

<ans> E: fire </ans>

The reason for this discrepancy is that the options provided in the question were not the most straightforward ones. In the analogy ""drive : car :: burn : E: fire"", cars are the agents that get driven, and fire is the result of burning. This analogy holds true, but it's not the most common one used when discussing the relationship between driving, cars, and burning. The more common analogy would be ""drive : car :: burn : fuel"", where cars use fuel to operate engines, and engines burn fuel to produce power for driving.

However, since the question provided the options D: wood and E: fire, the correct answer based on the given options is E: fire.</s>",,E
Function,open,door,touch,hands,doctor,"In the given notation ""open : door :: touch : ?"", we are trying to find the value of the question mark that makes the analogy ""open is to door like touch is to ?"" true.

The analogy ""open is to door"" suggests that opening is an action that requires a door as its object. Similarly, the analogy ""touch is to ?"" suggests that touching is an action that requires an object, which we don't know yet.

To complete the analogy, we need to find an object that is to touching as a door is to opening. One common object that is associated with touching is a hand. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> D: hands </ans>

So, the complete analogy would be ""open is to door like touch is to hands"".</s>",,D
Function,squeeze,juice,shoot,gun,miss,"The analogy ""squeeze : juice :: shoot : ?"" implies that squeezing is to juice as shooting is to something. In the given context, it is not clear what the missing term should be. However, we can make an educated guess based on the given terms.

The term ""juice"" is a liquid that is extracted from fruits or vegetables by squeezing. Therefore, the term ""squeeze"" can be considered as an action that results in the production of juice.

The term ""shoot"" is an action that involves releasing a projectile from a gun. Therefore, the missing term could be ""bullet"" or ""projectile"". However, since the question mark is not explicitly defined, we cannot be certain.

However, based on the given context, it is more likely that the missing term is ""bullet"" because the analogy seems to be suggesting that squeezing a gun (or something similar) results in a bullet being shot.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> D: gun </ans>

To find the answer, we need to identify what is common between cutting and hitting. Both cutting and hitting are actions that transfer energy from one object to another. However, the objects and the nature of the energy transfer are different.

Cutting involves using an edge to separate material, while hitting involves transferring energy to an object to make it move or deform. A more direct analogy for hitting would be something that causes a similar effect, such as hammering.

Therefore, the answer is:

In the given analogy ""throw : ball :: open : ?"", we have an action ""throw"" and an object ""ball"", and we want to find an object that completes the analogy with the action ""open"".

The action ""open"" is the opposite of ""closed"". So, we need to find an object that is to ""open"" as ""ball"" is to ""throw"". The answer is ""container"" or more specifically ""envelope"" when it is being opened.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> D: envelope </ans></s>",,D
Function,read,magazine,play,football,kids,"The analogy ""read : magazine :: play : ?"" means that reading is to magazines as playing is to something. In other words, reading and magazines are related in the same way that playing is related to something.

Magazines are a medium for delivering information and entertainment. Reading is an activity that involves consuming that information or entertainment.

Football is a physical activity that involves playing a game. Kids are a group of people who can engage in various activities, including playing football.

However, the analogy is not ""reading : magazines :: playing : kids"". Instead, it should be ""reading : magazines :: playing : football"".

So the answer is: <ans> D </ans>

Function,burn,fire,blow,wind,down,"The analogy ""burn : fire :: blow :?"" means that ""burning is to fire"" and ""blowing is to?"". We need to find the answer that makes this analogy true.

The answer is ""wind"". The reason is that burning is a process that involves fire, and wind is a process that involves blowing. In the same way, fire is associated with heat and flames, while wind is associated with movement and air. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> D: wind </ans></s>",,D
Function,ski,snow,swim,water,swimmer,"The analogy ""A : B :: C : D"" means that ""A is to B as C is to D."" In other words, B is to A as D is to C.

In the given analogy ""ski : snow :: swim : ?"", we know that ""ski is to snow"" and ""swim is to?"". We need to find the answer that makes the analogy true.

Since ""ski is to snow"", we can say that ""snow is to ski"". Now, we know that ""swim is to?"". So, we need to find what ""?"" is such that ""snow is to ski"" and ""swim is to ?"" have the same relationship.

The relationship between ""snow"" and ""ski"" is that of a substance and an activity performed on that substance. For example, snow is a substance, and skiing is an activity performed on snow.

Similarly, the relationship between ""swim"" and ""?"" should also be that of a substance and an activity performed on that substance.

The answer is ""water"". Swimming is an activity performed in water. Therefore, the final answer is:

Function,run,horse,pull,tractor,muscle,"The analogy ""A : B :: C : D"" means that ""A is to B as C is to D."" In other words, A and B are related in the same way that C and D are related.

In the given analogy ""run : horse :: pull : ?"", we have two actions (run and pull) and two things (horse and ?). The first analogy ""run : horse"" suggests that running is an action that is done by a horse. The second analogy ""pull : ?"" suggests that pulling is an action that is done with something.

To complete the analogy, we need to find what that something is. We know that horses can pull heavy loads, so a possible answer is ""a heavy load"". However, the question mark suggests that there might be another answer.

Another thing that can be pulled is a trigger, which is often used in guns. So another possible answer is ""a trigger"".

However, neither of these answers fully fits the analogy. Running and pulling a heavy load are not the same kind of relationship as running and pulling a trigger.

Instead, we can look for another analogy where running and pulling have the same relationship as two other things. One possible answer is ""run : horse :: pull : muscle"". In this analogy, running is an action that is done by a horse, and pulling is an action that is done by a muscle. Both horses and muscles are used to provide power and motion.

Function,write,poem,carve,statue,knife,"In the given notation ""write : poem :: carve : ?"", we are looking for an analogy where ""write a poem"" is related to ""carve"" in the same way that ""poem"" is related to ""?"".

A poem is a form of literary art that expresses ideas, emotions, and thoughts through the use of language. Carving, on the other hand, is a process of shaping a material, typically by cutting away excess material.

An analogy that fits this description is:

write : poem :: carve : statue

Explanation:
Just as writing a poem involves shaping language to express ideas and emotions, carving involves shaping a material to create a work of art. A poem is the final product of the writing process, and a statue is the final product of the carving process.

1. Riding a bicycle and drinking are both activities that require a vessel or container. For example, you might carry a water bottle while riding a bicycle. In this case, the answer would be ""D: cup"" because both riding and drinking involve using a container.
2. Riding a bicycle and drinking are both activities that involve consuming or using a substance. For example, you might ride a bicycle to get to a store to buy water to drink. In this case, the answer would be ""E: water"" because both riding and drinking involve using or consuming a substance.

Based on the context of the analogy, I believe the answer is ""D: cup"" because the analogy suggests that there is a container involved in both activities. However, the analogy could be interpreted in different ways, so there is some ambiguity.

Function,throw,ball,jump,parachute,walk,"The analogy ""A : B :: C : D"" means that the relationship between A and B is the same as the relationship between C and D. In the given example, ""throw : ball :: jump : ?"" we have an action (throw) and an object (ball), and we want to find an action (jump) that has the same relationship to some object (?).

The relationship between throw and ball is that of an agent performing an action on an object. The relationship between jump and the missing object should be the same. Therefore, the missing object should be something that can be jumped over or onto.

Hence, the answer is:

<ans> D: parachute </ans> is incorrect, as parachutes are not something that can be jumped onto or over.

<ans> E: step </ans> or <ans> E: stair </ans> could be correct, as they are things that can be jumped onto or over. However, the given example suggests that jump is an action, not an object. Therefore, the missing object should be an action as well.

Function,ride,elevator,sail,boat,wind,"In the given analogy ""ride : elevator :: sail : ?"", we have two pairs of related concepts: ""ride"" and ""elevator"", and ""sail"" and the unknown ""?"". The analogy suggests that the relationship between ""ride"" and ""elevator"" is the same as the relationship between ""sail"" and the unknown ""?"".

Let's break down the meaning of each term:

* ""Ride"" refers to moving while seated or standing on a vehicle or structure that is designed to transport people or goods from one place to another.
* ""Elevator"" is a type of transportation that moves people and goods between floors of a building.
* ""Sail"" refers to moving a boat or ship through water using sails instead of an engine or oars.
