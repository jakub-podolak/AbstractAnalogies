The missing term should complete the analogy such that the relationship between the first terms (remain and stay) is the same as the relationship between the second terms (begin and the missing term).

The correct answer is ""D: start"". The relationship between ""remain"" and ""stay"" is one of synonymy or near-synonymy, meaning they are very similar in meaning. Similarly, the relationship between ""begin"" and ""start"" is also one of synonymy or near-synonymy.

The answer should be an object that is used to hold or collect liquids, similar to how carpets are used to cover and protect floors, and how buckets are used to hold and carry liquids. The answer is ""D: pail"" because a pail is a type of container used to hold and carry liquids. Alternatively, ""E: milk"" does not complete the analogy correctly because milk is not a container, but rather a liquid that can be held in a container.</s>",,D
Synonym,shout,yell,leap,jump,fall,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The analogy ""shout : yell :: leap : ?"" means that shouting is to yelling as leaping is to the missing term.
