Opposite,somber,cheerful,lawyer,client,doctor,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: client

In this completion, the relationship is between a lawyer and their client. A lawyer is often associated with being serious and professional, much like a somber person is associated with being serious and solemn. The client, on the other hand, is often associated with being cheerful and optimistic, much like a cheerful person is associated with being happy and carefree. This completion suggests that the lawyer is the somber one, and the client is the cheerful one.

2. Completion E: doctor

In this completion, the relationship is between a lawyer and a doctor. A lawyer is often associated with being serious and professional, much like a somber person is associated with being serious and solemn. A doctor, on the other hand, is often associated with being cheerful and optimistic, much like a cheerful person is associated with being happy and carefree. This completion suggests that the lawyer is the somber one, and the doctor is the cheerful one.

3. Comparison of completions D and E

Both completions D and E suggest that the lawyer is the somber one, and the other profession is the cheerful one. However, completion D provides a more direct and logical connection between the lawyer and the client, as they are often associated with each other in a professional context. Completion E, on the other hand, provides a more general connection between a lawyer and a doctor, but it's not as direct or logical as the connection between a lawyer and a client.

4. Determining the correct completion

Based on the comparisons, I believe that completion D is the correct one. The relationship between a lawyer and a client is more direct and logical, and it provides a clearer connection between the somber and cheerful adjectives.

Opposite,late,early,win,lose,capture,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: lose

In this completion, ""win"" is paired with ""lose"", which are antonyms. This suggests that the analogy is comparing opposing or contrasting concepts. ""Late"" and ""early"" are also antonyms, so the analogy is likely to pair ""win"" with an antonym of ""capture"", which is ""lose"".

2. Completion E: capture

In this completion, ""win"" is paired with ""capture"", which are not necessarily antonyms. ""Win"" implies gaining or achieving something, while ""capture"" implies taking control of something. The analogy is not immediately clear, as ""late"" and ""early"" are not directly related to gaining or taking control.

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy

Completion D presents a clear and consistent relationship between the terms, with ""win"" and ""lose"" being antonyms. This relationship is consistent with the analogy, which pairs ""late"" and ""early"" as antonyms.

Completion E, on the other hand, presents a less clear relationship between the terms. While ""win"" and ""capture"" are not necessarily antonyms, they do share a common theme of achieving or gaining something. However, this relationship is not as direct or consistent as the one presented in completion D.

4. Determining the correct completion

Based on the comparisons, completion D presents a more consistent and clear relationship between the terms, which is consistent with the analogy. Therefore, I conclude that completion D is the correct completion.

Opposite,quick,slow,grow,wither,plant,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: wither

In this completion, ""wither"" is a verb that means to become dry and shriveled, often as a result of a lack of water or nutrients. This relates to the analogy because ""quick"" and ""slow"" are adjectives that describe speed, and ""grow"" and ""wither"" are verbs that describe the opposite effects of a stimulus (e.g., water or nutrients) on a plant. Withering is the opposite of growing, just as slow is the opposite of quick.

2. Completion E: plant

In this completion, ""plant"" is a noun that refers to a living organism that grows. This relates to the analogy because ""quick"" and ""slow"" are adjectives that describe speed, and ""grow"" is a verb that describes the action of a plant growing. However, ""plant"" is not a verb that describes the opposite effect of a stimulus on a plant, unlike ""wither"".

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy

Completion D presents a verb that describes the opposite effect of a stimulus on a plant, whereas completion E presents a noun that is a type of living organism that grows. The analogy is more focused on the relationship between the verbs ""grow"" and ""wither"", rather than the relationship between the nouns ""plant"" and ""quick/slow"".

4. Based on the comparisons, determine which completion (D or E) correctly completes the analogy

Based on the analysis, completion D correctly completes the analogy because it presents a verb that describes the opposite effect of a stimulus on a plant, which is consistent with the relationship between ""quick"" and ""slow"" in the analogy.

Opposite,antonym,synonym,selfish,generous,egocentric,"Here are my answers:

1. Completion D: Generous is an antonym of selfish, as both words describe a person's attitude towards others. In this sense, generous is the opposite of selfish, just as synonym is the opposite of antonym.

2. Completion E: Egocentric is not an antonym of selfish, but rather a related concept. Egocentric refers to a person's tendency to focus on themselves, which is a characteristic often associated with selfishness. However, egocentric is not a direct opposite of selfish.

3. Comparison: Completion D presents a clear antonymic relationship between generous and selfish, mirroring the relationship between antonym and synonym in the analogy. Completion E, on the other hand, presents a related but not antonymic relationship between egocentric and selfish.

4. Based on the comparisons, I conclude that completion D correctly completes the analogy, as it presents a direct antonymic relationship between generous and selfish, mirroring the relationship between antonym and synonym.

Opposite,quiet,noisy,last,first,final,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: ""first""

In this completion, ""first"" is being paired with ""last"" to create a contrast between the two. ""First"" is the opposite of ""last"" in terms of sequence or order, implying that the analogy is about contrasting extremes.

2. Completion E: ""final""

In this completion, ""final"" is being paired with ""last"" to create a sense of culmination or completion. ""Final"" implies a sense of completion or termination, whereas ""last"" implies a sense of being the most recent or remaining one.

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy:

The analogy ""quiet : noisy :: last :?"" suggests a contrast between two opposing states or qualities. Completion D (""first"") creates a contrast between sequence or order, whereas completion E (""final"") creates a sense of culmination or completion. The analogy seems to be more focused on the contrast between ""quiet"" and ""noisy"", which are opposing states, rather than sequence or order.

4. Based on the comparisons, I determine that completion E (""final"") correctly completes the analogy.

Opposite,start,stop,trivial,important,famous,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: important

In this completion, ""trivial"" is contrasted with ""important"", suggesting that the analogy is about degrees of significance or relevance. ""Start"" and ""stop"" are often used to describe the beginning and end of something, and ""trivial"" and ""important"" could be used to describe the level of significance of an event or activity.

2. Completion E: famous

In this completion, ""trivial"" is contrasted with ""famous"", suggesting that the analogy is about degrees of recognition or notoriety. ""Start"" and ""stop"" are often used to describe the beginning and end of something, and ""trivial"" and ""famous"" could be used to describe the level of recognition of an event or activity.

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy

Both completions D and E contrast ""trivial"" with another word that is antonymous with it. However, completion D uses a word that is more closely related to the concept of ""start"" and ""stop"", whereas completion E uses a word that is more closely related to the concept of recognition or notoriety.

4. Determining which completion is correct

Based on the comparison, I believe that completion D is a better fit for the analogy. The relationship between ""start"" and ""stop"" is more closely related to the concept of significance or relevance, which is also the relationship between ""trivial"" and ""important"". The relationship between ""trivial"" and ""famous"" is more closely related to the concept of recognition or notoriety, which is not as closely related to the concept of ""start"" and ""stop"".

Opposite,laugh,cry,cheap,expensive,inexpensive,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: expensive

In this completion, ""cheap"" is paired with ""expensive"", which are antonyms. This suggests that the analogy is comparing two opposing states or qualities. In the original analogy, ""laugh"" and ""cry"" are both emotional responses, but they are opposite in nature (one is a positive emotion, the other is a negative emotion). If we apply this same logic to the second part of the analogy, ""cheap"" and ""expensive"" are also opposing qualities, with ""cheap"" being a negative connotation and ""expensive"" being a positive connotation.

2. Completion E: inexpensive

In this completion, ""cheap"" is paired with ""inexpensive"", which are synonyms. This suggests that the analogy is comparing two similar states or qualities. However, this doesn't quite fit with the original analogy, where ""laugh"" and ""cry"" are opposite emotions. If we apply this same logic to the second part of the analogy, ""cheap"" and ""inexpensive"" are similar in meaning, but they don't quite capture the opposing nature of the original analogy.

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy

Completion D presents a relationship between ""cheap"" and ""expensive"" that is similar to the relationship between ""laugh"" and ""cry"" in the original analogy. Both pairs of words are antonyms, suggesting a contrast or opposition between them. Completion E, on the other hand, presents a relationship between ""cheap"" and ""inexpensive"" that is more similar in meaning, rather than contrasting.

4. Determining the correct completion

Based on the comparisons, I believe that completion D is the correct one. The analogy is comparing opposing states or qualities, and ""cheap"" and ""expensive"" fit this pattern nicely. Completion E, while it presents a similar relationship between the words, doesn't quite capture the opposing nature of the original analogy.

Opposite,accept,reject,dark,bright,dim,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: bright

In this completion, ""dark"" is paired with ""bright"", which are antonyms. This suggests that the analogy is comparing opposing or contrasting concepts. In the original analogy, ""accept"" and ""reject"" are opposing actions, and ""dark"" and ""bright"" are opposing states of light.

2. Completion E: dim

In this completion, ""dark"" is paired with ""dim"", which are both words that describe a lack of light. This suggests that the analogy is comparing words that have a similar meaning or connotation. However, ""accept"" and ""reject"" are not similar in meaning, and ""dark"" and ""dim"" are not opposing concepts.

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy

Completion D presents a relationship between opposing concepts, which is consistent with the original analogy. Completion E presents a relationship between words with similar meanings, which is not consistent with the original analogy.

4. Determining the correct completion

Based on the comparison, completion D is more consistent with the original analogy. The relationship between ""accept"" and ""reject"" is one of opposition, and the relationship between ""dark"" and ""bright"" is also one of opposition. This suggests that the correct completion is ""bright"".

Opposite,abundant,scarce,agree,disagree,concur,"Here's the analysis:

1. Completion D: disagree

In this completion, ""disagree"" is the opposite of ""agree"", which is a common antonymic relationship. This relationship is similar to the one between ""abundant"" and ""scarce"", where ""abundant"" is the opposite of ""scarce"". Therefore, completion D suggests that ""agree"" is the opposite of ""disagree"", which is a plausible relationship.

2. Completion E: concur

In this completion, ""concur"" means to agree or be in harmony, which is a positive relationship. However, this relationship is not directly related to the antonymic relationship between ""abundant"" and ""scarce"". ""Concur"" is not the opposite of ""agree"", but rather a synonym.

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy

Completion D presents an antonymic relationship between ""agree"" and ""disagree"", which is similar to the relationship between ""abundant"" and ""scarce"". Completion E presents a synonymic relationship between ""agree"" and ""concur"", which is not directly related to the analogy.

4. Determination of the correct completion

Based on the comparison, completion D presents a more plausible relationship with the analogy, as it maintains the antonymic relationship between the two pairs of words. Completion E does not present a direct relationship with the analogy.

Opposite,hero,coward,strong,weak,muscular,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: weak

In this completion, ""strong"" is contrasted with ""weak"", which is a common antonymic pair. The analogy is suggesting that just as a hero is the opposite of a coward, a strong person is the opposite of a weak person. This relationship is based on the idea of opposition or contrast.

2. Completion E: muscular

In this completion, ""strong"" is associated with ""muscular"", which is a common connotation of physical strength. The analogy is suggesting that just as a hero is a strong person, a strong person is a muscular person. This relationship is based on the idea of association or correlation.

3. Comparison of relationships:

Completion D presents a relationship of opposition or contrast, where ""strong"" and ""weak"" are antonyms. In contrast, completion E presents a relationship of association or correlation, where ""strong"" and ""muscular"" are related but not necessarily antonyms.

4. Determining the correct completion:

Based on the comparison, completion D presents a more accurate relationship with the analogy. The analogy is suggesting a contrast between ""hero"" and ""coward"", which is a common antonymic pair. Completion D maintains this contrast by presenting ""strong"" and ""weak"" as antonyms, whereas completion E introduces a new relationship that is not present in the analogy.

Opposite,teacher,student,calm,stormy,serene,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: stormy

In this completion, the relationship is that a teacher is to a student as a calm person is to a stormy person. This suggests that the teacher is the one who is calm and composed, while the student is the one who is stormy and unruly.

2. Completion E: serene

In this completion, the relationship is that a teacher is to a student as a serene person is to a calm person. This suggests that the teacher is the one who is serene and peaceful, while the student is the one who is calm and composed.

3. Comparison of relationships

Completion D presents a relationship where the teacher is the calm one, while the student is the stormy one. This is a reversal of the typical teacher-student relationship, where the teacher is often the authority figure and the student is the one who is learning.

Completion E presents a relationship where the teacher is the serene one, while the student is the calm one. This is a more typical relationship, where the teacher is often the one who is calm and composed, while the student is the one who is learning and may be more energetic or restless.

4. Determination of correct completion

Based on the comparisons, I believe that completion E is the correct one. The relationship presented in completion E is more typical and logical, where the teacher is the authority figure and the student is the one who is learning. Completion D presents a reversal of this relationship, which is less likely to be the intended meaning of the analogy.

Opposite,give,take,allow,forbid,permit,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: forbid
In this completion, ""forbid"" is the opposite of ""allow"", which is a correct relationship. ""Forbid"" means to prohibit or prevent something, which is the opposite of allowing something to happen.

2. Completion E: permit
In this completion, ""permit"" is not the opposite of ""allow"". Instead, ""permit"" means to give permission or authorization, which is a different relationship from the one established in the analogy.

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy:
The analogy ""give : take :: allow :?"" suggests a relationship of opposition or reversal. In the first part of the analogy, ""give"" and ""take"" are antonyms, and the analogy is asking for a word that is the opposite of ""allow"". Completion D, ""forbid"", fits this relationship, as it is the opposite of ""allow"". Completion E, ""permit"", does not fit this relationship, as it is not the opposite of ""allow"".

4. Based on the comparisons, I determine that completion D correctly completes the analogy.

Opposite,clean,dirty,awake,asleep,alert,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: asleep

In this completion, ""asleep"" is the opposite of ""awake"", just like ""dirty"" is the opposite of ""clean"". This suggests that the analogy is based on antonyms, where ""clean"" and ""dirty"" are antonyms, and ""awake"" and ""asleep"" are also antonyms.

2. Completion E: alert

In this completion, ""alert"" is not necessarily the opposite of ""awake"". While ""awake"" implies being conscious and alert, ""alert"" implies being vigilant and attentive, but not necessarily the opposite of being awake. This suggests that the analogy is not based on a simple opposition, but rather on a more nuanced relationship.

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy

Completion D presents a clear antonymic relationship between ""clean"" and ""dirty"", and ""awake"" and ""asleep"". This relationship is consistent with the analogy. Completion E, on the other hand, presents a more complex relationship between ""awake"" and ""alert"", which is not as straightforwardly antonymic.

4. Determining the correct completion

Based on the comparison, I conclude that completion D correctly completes the analogy. The antonymic relationship between ""clean"" and ""dirty"" and ""awake"" and ""asleep"" is a clear and consistent pattern that is maintained in the analogy.

Opposite,remember,forget,increase,decrease,lengthen,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: ""decrease"" relates to the analogy because ""remember"" and ""forget"" are antonyms, and ""increase"" and ""decrease"" are also antonyms. This suggests that the analogy is comparing pairs of words that are opposites.

2. Completion E: ""lengthen"" does not relate to the analogy in the same way. ""Remember"" and ""forget"" are not related to length, and ""increase"" and ""lengthen"" are not antonyms.

3. Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy, we can see that completion D maintains the same oppositional relationship between the words, whereas completion E introduces a new and unrelated concept.

4. Based on the comparisons, I conclude that completion D correctly completes the analogy because it maintains the same oppositional relationship between the words, whereas completion E does not.

5. Final answer: <ans> D </ans>",,D
Opposite,crazy,sane,bent,straight,crooked,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: straight

In this completion, ""bent"" is contrasted with ""straight"", which means a change from a curved or angled shape to a straight one. This relationship is similar to the contrast between ""crazy"" and ""sane"", where ""crazy"" implies a departure from a normal or rational state, and ""sane"" implies a return to a normal or rational state.

2. Completion E: crooked

In this completion, ""bent"" is contrasted with ""crooked"", which means a change from a straight or normal shape to a curved or angled one. This relationship is similar to the contrast between ""crazy"" and ""sane"", where ""crazy"" implies a departure from a normal or rational state, and ""sane"" implies a return to a normal or rational state.

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy

Both completions D and E present a contrast between two states, where one state is a departure from a normal or expected state, and the other state is a return to or a correction of that state. However, completion D presents a more direct and literal contrast between ""bent"" and ""straight"", whereas completion E presents a more nuanced and subtle contrast between ""bent"" and ""crooked"".

4. Determining the correct completion

Based on the comparison, I believe that completion D is a more accurate and literal completion of the analogy. The contrast between ""bent"" and ""straight"" is more direct and obvious, and it follows the same pattern as the contrast between ""crazy"" and ""sane"".

2. Completion E: shovel
In this completion, ""shovel"" is a tool used for ""digging"". This relationship is based on the idea that a shovel is an instrument used to perform the action of digging.

3. Comparison:
The analogy ""build : house :: dig :?"" suggests a relationship between actions and their products. In the given analogy, ""build"" is an action that creates a ""house"". Similarly, the completed analogy should have an action that creates a product.

Completion D (""hole"") relates to the analogy by creating a product (a hole) through the action of digging. This relationship is more direct and aligns with the analogy's theme of actions and their products.

Completion E (""shovel"") relates to the analogy by providing a tool used for digging, but it doesn't create a product. Instead, it's an instrument used to perform the action of digging.

2. Completion E: ""wear :? :: hear : ear :: wear is a verb that means to adorn or decorate, and a woman is the object being adorned. Similarly, hear is a verb that means to perceive sound, and ear is the organ that perceives sound.""

3. Comparison: Completion D relates the verb ""wear"" to the object being worn, which is clothes. Completion E relates the verb ""wear"" to the object being adorned, which is a woman. The analogy is about the relationship between a verb and its object, not about the meaning of the verb.

4. Based on the comparison, completion D correctly completes the analogy because it maintains the same relationship between the verb and its object as in the original analogy. The relationship is about the object being perceived or affected by the action, not about the meaning of the action.

Function,open,door,touch,hands,doctor,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: hands
In this completion, ""hands"" is the object that is typically used to perform the action of ""touch"". This is a common association, as we often use our hands to touch or feel things.

2. Completion E: doctor
In this completion, ""doctor"" is not directly related to the action of ""touch"". A doctor is a medical professional, and while they may perform physical examinations, the word ""doctor"" is not typically associated with the action of touching.

3. Comparison:
The analogy ""open : door :: touch :?"" suggests a relationship between the action ""open"" and the object ""door"", implying that the action is performed on the object. In completion D, ""hands"" is the object that performs the action of ""touch"", which is consistent with the analogy. In completion E, ""doctor"" is not an object that performs the action of ""touch"", but rather a profession that may involve touching.

1. Completion D: ""gun"" relates to the analogy because ""squeeze"" is a way to extract juice from an object (e.g., an orange), and ""gun"" is a way to shoot something (e.g., a bullet). The relationship is one of means to an end, where the action (squeeze or shoot) produces a result (juice or bullet).

2. Completion E: ""miss"" does not directly relate to the analogy. ""Squeeze"" is an action that produces a result (juice), whereas ""miss"" is a verb that means to fail to hit or score. The relationship between ""squeeze"" and ""juice"" is not comparable to the relationship between ""miss"" and a specific object or outcome.

3. Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy, we see that completion D presents a similar relationship between the actions and their results, whereas completion E does not.

2. Completion E: ""close""
In this completion, ""close"" is related to ""open"" as a contrasting action, implying that ""close"" is the opposite of ""open"".

3. Comparison of relationships:
The analogy ""throw : ball :: open :?"" suggests a relationship between the actions ""throw"" and ""open"". In the analogy, ""throw"" is an action that can be performed on a ""ball"", and ""open"" is an action that can be performed on something (the question mark). Completion D suggests that ""open"" is an action that can be performed on an ""envelope"", which is a plausible relationship. Completion E suggests that ""open"" is the opposite of ""close"", which is also a plausible relationship, but it doesn't directly relate to the action of ""throw"" on a ""ball"".

Function,drink,glass,cook,pan,chef,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: pan
In this completion, ""cook"" is an action, and ""pan"" is a tool used for cooking. This relationship is similar to the analogy, where ""drink"" is an action, and ""glass"" is a container used for drinking.

2. Completion E: chef
In this completion, ""cook"" is an action, and ""chef"" is a person who performs the action of cooking. This relationship is different from the analogy, where ""drink"" is an action, and ""glass"" is an object used for the action, not a person performing the action.

3. Comparison of relationships:
Completion D presents a relationship between an action (""cook"") and an object used for that action (""pan""), which is similar to the analogy. Completion E presents a relationship between an action (""cook"") and a person performing that action (""chef""), which is different from the analogy.

4. Based on the comparisons, I conclude that completion D correctly completes the analogy because it presents a relationship between an action and an object used for that action, which is similar to the analogy.

Function,burn,fire,blow,wind,down,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: wind
In this completion, ""blow"" is related to ""wind"" as ""burn"" is related to ""fire"". Both ""blow"" and ""burn"" are actions that can cause or contribute to the existence of ""wind"" and ""fire"", respectively.

2. Completion E: down
In this completion, ""blow"" is related to ""down"" as ""burn"" is related to ""fire"". However, this relationship is not as clear-cut as the one in completion D. ""Blow"" can also mean to blow something away or to blow something down, but it's not as direct a connection as the one between ""burn"" and ""fire"".

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy:
Completion D presents a more direct and clear connection between the actions and the resulting states (""burn"" and ""fire"", ""blow"" and ""wind""). Completion E, on the other hand, presents a more indirect connection, and the relationship between ""blow"" and ""down"" is not as strong as the one between ""burn"" and ""fire"".

Function,ski,snow,swim,water,swimmer,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: water
In this completion, ""water"" is the medium or substance in which the activity of ""swim"" takes place. This is similar to how ""snow"" is the medium or substance in which the activity of ""ski"" takes place.

2. Completion E: swimmer
In this completion, ""swimmer"" is a person who engages in the activity of ""swim"", similar to how ""skier"" is a person who engages in the activity of ""ski"". However, this completion doesn't directly relate to the medium or substance in which the activity takes place, which is the core idea of the analogy.

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy:
Completion D relates to the analogy by highlighting the similarity in the medium or substance in which the activities take place. Completion E, on the other hand, relates to the analogy by highlighting the similarity in the person who engages in the activity, but this is not the core idea of the analogy.

Function,tell,story,fight,battle,soldier,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: ""battle""
In this completion, ""fight"" is related to ""battle"" as a specific instance or example of a larger category. A ""fight"" is a type of ""battle"", just as a ""story"" is a type of ""narrative"" in the original analogy.

2. Completion E: ""soldier""
In this completion, ""fight"" is related to ""soldier"" as a specific action or activity that a soldier might engage in. A ""soldier"" might ""fight"", just as a ""storyteller"" might ""tell a story"" in the original analogy.

3. Comparison of relationships:
In completion D, the relationship is one of categorization or classification, where ""fight"" is a specific instance of a larger category (""battle""). In completion E, the relationship is one of agency or action, where ""fight"" is an activity that a ""soldier"" might engage in.

4. Based on the comparisons:
The correct completion is the one that maintains the same relationship between the original terms as the analogy suggests. In this case, the analogy suggests a relationship of categorization or classification, which is maintained in completion D (""battle""). Completion E, on the other hand, introduces a relationship of agency or action, which is not present in the original analogy.

Function,run,horse,pull,tractor,muscle,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: tractor

In this completion, ""tractor"" is related to ""pull"" as a vehicle is related to an action. Just as a horse is often associated with running, a tractor is often associated with pulling or hauling heavy loads.

2. Completion E: muscle

In this completion, ""muscle"" is related to ""pull"" as a physical attribute is related to an action. Just as a horse has the physical ability to run, a muscle is a physical attribute that enables pulling or other physical actions.

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy:

Both completions relate ""pull"" to a physical entity or attribute, but they differ in the nature of the relationship. Completion D focuses on the vehicle-action relationship, while completion E focuses on the physical attribute-action relationship.

4. Based on the comparisons, I determine that completion D correctly completes the analogy.

The analogy ""run : horse :: pull :?"" suggests a relationship between an action and a vehicle or entity that enables that action. Completion D, ""tractor"", fits this relationship better than completion E, ""muscle"", which is more focused on the physical attribute of pulling rather than the entity that enables pulling.

Function,write,poem,carve,statue,knife,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: statue
In this completion, ""carve"" is related to ""statue"" as ""write"" is related to ""poem"". Both ""carve"" and ""write"" are actions that create or modify a pre-existing entity (a statue or a poem, respectively). This relationship is one of creation or modification.

2. Completion E: knife
In this completion, ""carve"" is related to ""knife"" as ""write"" is related to... nothing. ""Carve"" is an action that uses a knife, but there is no direct relationship between ""write"" and a specific tool or object.

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy
Completion D presents a relationship between ""carve"" and ""statue"" that is similar to the relationship between ""write"" and ""poem"". Both pairs of words are related through the action of creation or modification. Completion E, on the other hand, presents a relationship between ""carve"" and ""knife"" that is more about the tool used to perform the action, rather than the action itself.

4. Based on the comparisons, I determine that completion D correctly completes the analogy.

Function,throw,ball,jump,parachute,walk,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: parachute

In this completion, ""parachute"" is related to ""jump"" as a means of slowing down or controlling the descent. This is because parachutes are often used to slow down the fall of objects or people during a jump from a great height.

2. Completion E: walk

In this completion, ""walk"" is related to ""jump"" as a form of movement. This is because both ""jump"" and ""walk"" are forms of locomotion, but they differ in terms of the type of movement involved.

3. Comparison of relationships:

The relationship between ""throw"" and ""ball"" in the analogy is that a ball is something that is thrown. The relationship between ""jump"" and the completed phrase in the analogy should be similar. Completion D suggests that a parachute is something that is used to slow down or control the descent during a jump, which is a plausible relationship. Completion E, on the other hand, suggests that a walk is a form of movement, which is not a direct relationship to the act of jumping.

4. Based on the comparisons, the correct completion is:

The final answer is that the correct completion is ""parachute"".",,D
Function,ride,elevator,sail,boat,wind,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: ""sail : boat""

This completion relates to the analogy by suggesting that, just as ""ride"" is a way to travel using an ""elevator"", ""sail"" is a way to travel using a ""boat"". This completion is based on a similarity in the mode of transportation.

2. Completion E: ""sail : wind""

This completion relates to the analogy by suggesting that, just as ""ride"" is a way to travel using an ""elevator"" (which is a mechanical device), ""sail"" is a way to travel using the ""wind"" (which is a natural force). This completion is based on a similarity in the means of propulsion.

3. Comparison of completions D and E with the analogy:

Completion D focuses on the vehicle or device used for transportation, while completion E focuses on the means of propulsion. The analogy ""ride : elevator :: sail :?"" seems to be more concerned with the vehicle or device, rather than the means of propulsion.

Category Members,vegetable,cabbage,insect,beetle,frog,"Here are my answers:

1. Completion D: beetle relates to the analogy because both ""vegetable"" and ""cabbage"" are types of vegetables, and both ""insect"" and ""beetle"" are types of insects. The analogy is suggesting that just as cabbage is a specific type of vegetable, beetle is a specific type of insect.

2. Completion E: frog does not relate to the analogy in the same way. While frogs are insects, the analogy is not suggesting that frog is a specific type of insect, but rather a specific type of animal. The analogy is focused on the relationship between a general category (vegetable/insect) and a specific example (cabbage/beetle).

3. Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E, we can see that completion D maintains the same relationship between the general category and the specific example, whereas completion E introduces a different relationship.

Category Members,clothing,jeans,vegetable,potato,apple,"Here's my analysis:

1. Completion D: potato

In this completion, ""potato"" is a type of vegetable, just like ""jeans"" is a type of clothing. This relationship is based on categorization, where both ""jeans"" and ""potato"" are specific examples of their respective categories.

2. Completion E: apple

In this completion, ""apple"" is a type of fruit, which is a different category from ""vegetable"". This relationship is based on a different categorization, where ""apple"" is a specific example of a fruit, but not a vegetable.

3. Comparison of relationships:

Completion D relates to the analogy by establishing a similar categorization relationship between ""clothing"" and ""vegetable"", where both are categories with specific examples. Completion E, on the other hand, introduces a different categorization relationship, where ""apple"" is a specific example of a fruit, which is not related to the category of ""vegetable"".

4. Based on the comparisons:

Completion D correctly completes the analogy by maintaining the same categorization relationship between ""clothing"" and ""vegetable"", whereas Completion E introduces a different relationship.
