Synonym,easy,simple,sad,unhappy,happy,"1. Completion D, ""unhappy,"" is related to the analogy as the counterpart to ""simple"" in the first pair, ""easy : simple."" The term ""simple"" implies a lack of complexity or difficulty. Similarly, ""unhappy"" implies a lack of happiness or positivity.

2. Completion E, ""happy,"" is not related to the analogy as the counterpart to ""sad"" in the second pair, ""sad : ?"". The term ""happy"" is the opposite of ""sad,"" but it does not fit the pattern of the analogy, which requires a term that is related to the term in the first pair in a similar way to how the second term is related to the term in the second pair.

3. Completion D, ""unhappy,"" and the term ""simple"" are both related to their respective terms in the analogy in the sense that they imply a lack or absence of something. In the case of ""simple,"" it implies a lack of complexity or difficulty, while ""unhappy"" implies a lack of happiness or positivity. Completion E, ""happy,"" does not fit this pattern as it is the opposite of ""sad,"" but it does not imply a lack or absence of anything in the same way that ""simple"" and ""unhappy"" do.

4. Based on the comparisons, completion D, ""unhappy,"" correctly completes the analogy as it follows the pattern of the analogy, which requires terms that are related to their respective terms in the same way.

Synonym,hurry,rush,harm,injure,help,"1. Completion D, ""injure,"" relates to the analogy as ""rush"" can cause ""harm,"" and ""hurry"" can cause ""injure."" Both ""rush"" and ""hurry"" imply a sense of urgency or haste, and ""harm"" and ""injure"" both imply negative consequences.

2. Completion E, ""help,"" does not relate to the analogy as ""rush"" does not cause ""help,"" and ""hurry"" does not cause ""help."" The relationship between ""hurry"" and ""help"" is not inverse to the relationship between ""hurry"" and ""harm.""

3. Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy, we see that completion D correctly completes the analogy as it maintains the inverse relationship between the two pairs. In the analogy, ""hurry"" is related to ""rush"" as ""harm"" is related to ""rush,"" and ""hurry"" is related to ""harm"" as ""rush"" is related to ""injure.""

Synonym,rob,steal,cry,weep,laugh,"1. Completion D, ""weep,"" is the correct answer because in the analogy, ""rob"" and ""steal"" are related as actions of taking something from someone without permission. Similarly, ""cry"" and ""weep"" are related as actions expressing emotion, particularly sadness.

2. Completion E, ""laugh,"" does not fit the analogy because ""laugh"" is an expression of happiness or amusement, while ""cry"" and ""weep"" are expressions of sadness.

3. The relationships presented in completions D and E are quite different. Completion D correctly completes the analogy by maintaining the emotional theme, while completion E introduces a different emotion, happiness, which does not fit the analogy.

4. Based on the comparisons, completion D is the correct answer as it correctly completes the analogy by maintaining the emotional theme.

Synonym,polite,courteous,angry,furious,happy,"1. Completion D, ""furious,"" is the correct answer because in the analogy, ""polite"" is related to ""courteous"" as a synonym or a milder form of the same quality. Similarly, ""angry"" is related to ""furious"" as a stronger or more intense form of the same emotion.
2. Completion E, ""happy,"" does not relate to the analogy as it is not an emotion that is opposite or related in intensity to ""angry.""
3. The relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy are as follows:
   - Completion D, ""furious,"" correctly completes the analogy as it is an emotion that is opposite in intensity to ""courteous"" (mild) and related in meaning to ""angry"" (intense).
   - Completion E, ""happy,"" does not complete the analogy as it is not an emotion that is opposite or related in intensity to ""angry.""

Synonym,beginner,novice,doctor,physician,heal,"1. Completion D, ""doctor : physician,"" completes the analogy by providing a specific type of doctor that fits the role of C in the analogy. The analogy suggests that a beginner is to novice as a doctor is to something related to healing. A physician is a type of doctor who specializes in healing and curing illnesses, making it a suitable completion for C.

2. Completion E, ""doctor : heal,"" does not correctly complete the analogy. While a doctor is indeed involved in healing, the analogy requires a specific role or title for the doctor, not the action of healing itself.

3. Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E:
   - Completion D establishes a relationship between a beginner and a novice, and a doctor and a physician. Both pairs are related by their roles and titles.
   - Completion E, on the other hand, establishes a relationship between a doctor and the action of healing. This relationship does not fit the analogy as it does not provide a suitable completion for C.

Synonym,baby,infant,woman,lady,girl,"1. Completion D, ""lady,"" is correct because a woman in her adult years is to a man or to society as an infant is to a baby. Both a woman and an infant are younger versions of their respective mature forms. A lady is an adult woman, just as a baby is the younger form of an infant.

2. Completion E, ""girl,"" is not the correct answer because a girl is not the mature form of a woman, but rather a younger version of a woman. The analogy is comparing the relationship between a baby and an infant to that of a woman and her mature form.

3. Completion D, ""lady,"" correctly completes the analogy by maintaining the relationship between the younger and older forms. Completion E, ""girl,"" does not complete the analogy as it does not represent the mature form of a woman.

Just as ""huge"" is used to describe something that is very large, ""wealthy"" is used to describe someone or something that has a great deal of financial resources. ""Rich"" is another term used to describe having a large amount of financial resources, making it a fitting completion for the analogy.
2. Completion E, ""poor,"" does not relate to the analogy in the same way as completion D. While ""huge"" and ""enormous"" both describe something that is large, ""wealthy"" and ""poor"" describe opposite ends of the financial spectrum. ""Poor"" is not equivalent to ""enormous"" in the same way that ""wealthy"" is to ""huge.""
3. The relationships presented in completions D and E differ significantly. Completion D, ""rich,"" completes the analogy by maintaining the relationship between ""huge"" and ""enormous."" Both ""huge"" and ""enormous"" describe something that is large, and ""wealthy"" and ""rich"" both describe having a large amount of resources. Completion E, ""poor,"" does not maintain the relationship between ""huge"" and ""enormous."" Instead, it describes the opposite end of the financial spectrum from ""wealthy.""
4. Based on the comparisons, completion D is the correct completion for the analogy.

Synonym,cheerful,happy,awful,horrible,wonderful,"1. Completion D, ""horrible,"" is a synonym for ""awful,"" and ""happy"" is a synonym for ""joyful"" or ""pleased,"" which is a positive emotion. Therefore, ""cheerful"" is a positive adjective used to describe someone who is happy or pleased, and ""awful"" is a negative adjective used to describe something or someone that is very bad or unpleasant.
2. Completion E, ""wonderful,"" is an opposite of ""awful."" While ""happy"" and ""cheerful"" are positive emotions, ""wonderful"" is a term used to describe something or someone that is excellent or impressive. However, it does not fit the analogy as well as completion D because ""wonderful"" is not a synonym for ""awful.""
3. Completion D, ""horrible,"" is a negative term that is a synonym for ""awful,"" and completion D completes the analogy by maintaining the relationship between the positive and negative emotions. Completion E, ""wonderful,"" is a positive term that is an opposite of ""awful,"" but it does not maintain the relationship between the positive and negative emotions in the analogy.

""Start"" is the action that initiates an activity similar to how ""begin"" does in the analogy.

2. Completion E, ""continue,"" relates to the analogy as a synonym for ""remain."" Both ""remain"" and ""continue"" imply a persistence or continuation of an action. However, ""begin"" and ""remain"" have different meanings. ""Begin"" is the action that initiates an activity, while ""remain"" implies continuing to do something.

3. The relationship presented in completion D is that of an opposition, where ""remain"" and ""stay"" are opposites, and ""begin"" and ""start"" are also opposites. The relationship presented in completion E is that of a synonym, where ""remain"" and ""continue"" have similar meanings.

Synonym,unusual,strange,famous,renowned,unknown,"1. Completion D, ""renowned,"" relates to the analogy by suggesting that ""famous"" is to something that is widely recognized and respected in the same way that ""unusual"" is to something that is not typical or common but still has some level of recognition or notoriety.
2. Completion E, ""unknown,"" relates to the analogy by suggesting that ""famous"" is to something that is well-known, while ""unusual"" is to something that is not known or recognized. However, this completion does not accurately reflect the relationship between ""unusual"" and ""strange,"" as ""strange"" implies a sense of intrigue or curiosity, while ""unknown"" implies a lack of information or familiarity.
3. The relationship presented in completion D accurately reflects the relationship between ""unusual"" and ""strange,"" as both terms imply a deviation from the norm, but with ""strange"" carrying a slightly more negative connotation. The relationship presented in completion E does not accurately reflect the relationship between ""unusual"" and ""strange,"" as ""unknown"" does not carry the same implications of intrigue or curiosity as ""strange.""

Synonym,legal,lawful,usual,normal,strange,"1. Completion D, ""normal,"" is the correct answer because in the context of the analogy, ""lawful"" and ""usual"" both imply a sense of conformity or adherence to a norm. Therefore, ""normal"" is the term that completes the analogy most accurately.
2. Completion E, ""strange,"" does not fit the analogy because ""strange"" implies something that is not normal or unusual, which is the opposite of the relationship suggested by the analogy between ""legal"" and ""lawful"" and ""usual.""
3. The relationship between ""legal"" and ""lawful"" is one of synonymy or near-synonymy, as ""lawful"" means ""in accordance with the law."" The relationship between ""usual"" and ""normal"" is also one of synonymy or near-synonymy, as ""usual"" means ""common"" or ""regular,"" and ""normal"" means ""conforming to a standard"" or ""typical."" Both pairs of terms describe a sense of conformity or adherence to a norm.

2. Completion E, ""stay,"" does not fit the analogy as well. While ""leave"" implies departing from a location, ""stay"" means remaining at that location. The analogy is looking for an opposite to ""gather"" and ""collect,"" not a synonym for ""leave.""
3. Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy, we see that D correctly completes the analogy. Completion D, ""abandon,"" is the opposite of ""collect"" and ""gather,"" as one can collect or gather items and then abandon them, leaving them behind. Completion E, ""stay,"" is not the opposite of ""collect"" or ""gather.""

Synonym,clean,neat,fortunate,lucky,miserable,"1. Completion D, ""lucky,"" relates to the analogy as something that is favorable or fortunate. Neat is a quality that implies orderliness and organization, and clean is a quality that implies freedom from dirt or debris. Similarly, fortunate implies having good luck or favorable circumstances, and lucky is a term that specifically refers to having good fortune.
2. Completion E, ""miserable,"" does not relate to the analogy in a meaningful way. While neat and clean are positive qualities, miserable is a negative quality that implies sadness, misery, or unhappiness. Fortunate, on the other hand, is a positive term that implies good luck or favorable circumstances.
3. The relationships presented in completions D and E are quite different. Completion D, ""lucky,"" maintains the positive tone of the analogy by suggesting a fortunate or favorable outcome. Completion E, ""miserable,"" would introduce a negative tone that is not present in the analogy.

2. Completion E, ""approximate,"" relates to the analogy by suggesting that just as immense and colossal are used to describe very large quantities, precise and approximate are used to describe something that is not exactly right or true, but close.
3. In the analogy, ""immense"" and ""colossal"" are used to describe large quantities, while ""precise"" and ""exact"" are used to describe something that is free from error or inconsistency. Completion D, ""exact,"" correctly completes the analogy by maintaining the comparison between large quantities and something free from error or inconsistency. Completion E, ""approximate,"" does not correctly complete the analogy as it suggests a comparison between large quantities and something that is not exactly right or true, which is not the intended comparison in the analogy.

2. Completion E, ""lower,"" does not relate correctly to the analogy. ""Lower"" is the opposite of ""raise,"" so it would not complete the analogy correctly as ""aid"" and ""help"" are not opposites of ""raise"" and ""lift,"" respectively.
3. The relationships presented in completions D and E differ significantly. Completion D correctly completes the analogy by maintaining the parallelism between the two sides of the analogy, as both ""aid"" and ""lift"" support or assist, and both ""help"" and ""lift"" raise or elevate. Completion E, on the other hand, does not maintain the parallelism as ""lower"" is the opposite of ""raise,"" not the parallel to ""lift.""

2. Completion E, ""fall,"" does not relate to the analogy. The analogy compares ""shout"" to ""yell"" and ""leap"" to an equivalent action. ""Fall"" is not an equivalent action to ""leap"" or ""jump.""

3. Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy:
   - Completion D, ""jump,"" correctly completes the analogy as it is a synonym for ""leap.""
   - Completion E, ""fall,"" does not complete the analogy as it is not related to the actions described in the analogy.

In nature, there are often enemies or competitors that exist, while in the case of artificial things, they may not have enemies in the same way that natural things do.

2. Completion E, ""relative,"" does not correctly relate to the analogy. While relatives are related to each other, they are not opposites or counterparts to friends in the same way that natural things are to artificial things.

3. Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy, we can see that completion D correctly completes the analogy by providing an opposite or counterpart relationship to ""friend"" in the context of ""natural"" and ""artificial.""

2. Completion E, ""conquer,"" does not directly relate to the analogy. While ""dead"" and ""alive"" are opposites in terms of a living state, ""succeed"" and ""conquer"" are not directly opposites. ""Conquer"" implies gaining control over something, while ""succeed"" implies achieving a goal.
3. Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy, we see that completion D, ""fail,"" is a more accurate completion as it directly opposes ""succeed"" in the same way that ""dead"" opposes ""alive."" Completion E, ""conquer,"" while related to the concept of achieving a goal, does not directly oppose ""succeed"" in the same way that ""dead"" opposes ""alive.""

3. In the analogy, ""ugliness : beauty,"" the relationship is one of opposites. Completion D, ""sorrow,"" also represents an opposite emotion to joy, making it a closer fit for the analogy. Completion E, ""emotion,"" is a more general term that includes both joy and sorrow, but it doesn't directly represent an opposite emotion to joy.

2. Completion E, ""come,"" also relates to the analogy as a concept that is connected to ""arrive."" However, it is not the opposite of ""tiny"" in the same way that ""depart"" is the opposite of ""huge."" Instead, ""come"" is a synonym for ""arrive,"" meaning that both words refer to the act of an object moving towards a location.
3. The relationships presented in completions D and E differ in that D provides an opposite concept to ""huge"" and ""arrive,"" while E provides a synonym for ""arrive.""

Opposite,somber,cheerful,lawyer,client,doctor,"1. In the analogy, ""somber"" is compared to ""cheerful."" ""Somber"" means serious and solemn, while ""cheerful"" means happy and light-hearted. In the context of the analogy, a lawyer is being compared to something based on this contrast. Completion D, ""client,"" fits because clients can come to lawyers with serious and solemn issues, such as legal disputes or personal problems, while lawyers provide advice and representation to help resolve those issues.

2. Completion E, ""doctor,"" does not fit the analogy as well. While a doctor can provide relief and happiness to a patient, the relationship between a doctor and a patient is not directly analogous to the relationship between a somber person and a cheerful person.

3. Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy, we can see that completion D aligns more closely with the contrast between ""somber"" and ""cheerful."" A lawyer, in this context, is someone who provides a solution or relief to a serious problem, much like how a client comes to a lawyer with a serious issue. Completion E, on the other hand, does not directly relate to the contrast between ""somber"" and ""cheerful.""

Opposite,antonym,synonym,selfish,generous,egocentric,"1. In the analogy, antonym and synonym are related as opposites. The word ""synonym"" means a word or phrase that has the same or nearly the same meaning as another word or phrase. Therefore, completion D, ""generous,"" is a synonym for the antonym of ""selfish."" Generous means showing a readiness to give help or money, especially towards a good cause. Selfish is the opposite, meaning concerned primarily with one's own interests.

2. Completion E, ""egocentric,"" is a term that refers to a person who is excessively self-centered and unable to see things from other people's perspectives. While it is related to the concept of selfishness, it is not a synonym. An egocentric person may still be selfish, but the terms are not interchangeable.

3. The relationships presented in completions D and E are different. Completion D correctly completes the analogy by providing a synonym for the antonym of selfish.

2. Completion E, ""final,"" is a more appropriate completion for the analogy. ""Quiet"" and ""noisy"" are related to volume or sound level, while ""last"" and ""final"" are related to the end or conclusion of a series.
3. Completion D, ""first,"" does not share the same relationship as ""quiet"" to ""noisy."" ""Quiet"" and ""noisy"" are opposites in terms of volume or sound level, while ""first"" and ""last"" are opposites in terms of order or sequence.

In other words, just as ""trivial"" matters little to the overall significance of ""start,"" ""important"" matters greatly to the overall significance of ""stop.""
2. Completion E, ""famous,"" does not directly relate to the analogy. While ""start"" and ""stop"" can be seen as having a cause-and-effect relationship, ""famous"" is not a natural fit for the analogy as it does not share the same relationship with ""trivial"" as ""important"" does with ""stop.""
3. Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy, we see that completion D correctly completes the analogy by maintaining the relationship between ""trivial"" and ""start"" and extending it to ""important"" and ""stop."" Completion E, on the other hand, does not maintain the relationship between ""trivial"" and ""start"" and instead introduces an unrelated concept.

2. Completion E, ""inexpensive,"" also relates to the analogy but in a different way. It suggests that just as laughing is the opposite emotion to crying, cheap is the opposite of inexpensive. In this context, cheap and inexpensive are used interchangeably to describe low prices or costs.

3. The relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy are similar in that they both suggest oppositeness between laughing and crying, and between cheap and something else. However, the key difference lies in what that something else is. Completion D suggests that the opposite of cheap is expensive, while completion E suggests that the opposite of cheap is inexpensive.

4. Based on the comparisons, completion D is the correct completion as it correctly completes the analogy by suggesting that the opposite of cheap is expensive, just as the opposite of crying is laughing.

Category Members,tool,pliers,vehicle,van,fuel,"1. Completion D, ""van,"" is a correct completion of the analogy because a tool, like pliers, is used to manipulate or shape materials, and a vehicle, like a van, is used to transport people or goods from one place to another. Both pliers and a van serve distinct but related functions in their respective domains.

2. Completion E, ""fuel,"" is not a correct completion of the analogy. While pliers and a vehicle both require some form of energy to function, fuel is not a suitable completion because it does not share the same relationship with a vehicle as pliers do with a tool. Fuel is a substance that provides energy for a vehicle to move, but it does not have the same manipulative or shaping function that pliers have.

3. Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy, we can see that completion D correctly completes the analogy by maintaining the relationship between the tool and the vehicle as that of a manipulative instrument and a means of transportation, respectively. Completion E, on the other hand, does not maintain this relationship, as fuel is not a means of transportation but rather a source of energy for a vehicle.
