Synonym,sick,ill,little,small,big,<ans> D </ans></s>,,D
Synonym,legal,lawful,usual,normal,strange,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

In this analogy, ""legal"" refers to something that is in accordance with the law, while ""lawful"" means something that is lawful or permitted by law. Similarly, ""usual"" refers to something that is common or normal, while the missing term should be something that is also common or normal. Therefore, the correct answer is ""normal"" (completion D).

The term ""strange"" (completion E) does not fit the analogy as it refers to something that is unusual or abnormal, which is not the intended meaning of the missing term.</s>",,D
Synonym,collect,gather,leave,abandon,stay,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The correct completion for the analogy ""collect : gather :: leave : ?"" is ""abandon"". The analogy is saying that just as collecting and gathering are two ways to obtain items, leaving and abandoning are two ways to disengage from a situation.</s>",,D

Opposite,artificial,natural,friend,enemy,relative,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The correct completion for the analogy ""artificial : natural :: friend : ?"" is ""enemy"". The analogy compares two pairs of contrasting concepts: artificial vs natural, and friend vs enemy. Artificial and natural are opposites in the sense that artificial objects are made by humans, while natural objects exist in nature without human intervention. Similarly, friend and enemy are opposites in the sense that friends are people who support and help each other, while enemies are people who oppose and harm each other. Therefore, the correct completion is ""enemy"".</s>",,D

Explanation:

The analogy ""alive : dead :: succeed : ?"" requires that ""dead"" and ""succeed"" be related in the same way that ""alive"" and ""succeed"" are related. Since ""alive"" and ""dead"" are opposites, the correct completion is ""fail"", which is the opposite of ""succeed"". Therefore, the answer is ""D: fail"".</s>",,D
Opposite,ugliness,beauty,joy,sorrow,emotion,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The analogy ""ugliness : beauty"" suggests a contrast between two concepts, where one is considered less desirable or pleasing than the other. The second part of the analogy, ""joy : ?"", also implies a contrast between two concepts, but the second concept is not clearly defined.

Option D, ""sorrow"", is a concept that is often considered the opposite of joy, making it the correct completion for the analogy. Option E, ""emotion"", is a broader concept that includes both joy and sorrow, and therefore does not fit the analogy as well.</s>",,D
Opposite,huge,tiny,arrive,depart,come,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The analogy ""huge : tiny :: arrive : ?"" is saying that ""huge"" is to ""tiny"" in the same way that ""arrive"" is to something else.

Opposite,late,early,win,lose,capture,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The analogy ""late : early :: win : ?"" requires completing the analogy with a term that makes the analogy consistent. In this case, the correct completion is ""lose"". The analogy suggests that just as ""late"" is the opposite of ""early"", ""lose"" is the opposite of ""win"".</s>",,D
Opposite,quick,slow,grow,wither,plant,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The analogy ""quick : slow :: grow : ?"" requires completing the analogy with a term that is related to ""grow"" in the same way that ""slow"" is related to ""quick"". The term ""wither"" is the correct completion as it means to gradually lose vitality or strength, which is the opposite of ""grow"".

Opposite,antonym,synonym,selfish,generous,egocentric,<ans> D </ans></s>,,D
Opposite,quiet,noisy,last,first,final,"<ans> E </ans>

Explanation:

The analogy ""quiet : noisy"" describes a contrast between two states of sound. The analogy ""last : ?"" should describe a similar contrast between two states or concepts related to the order or sequence.

The correct completion is ""final"" because ""last"" refers to the most recent or final item in a sequence, while ""quiet"" and ""noisy"" describe contrasting states of sound. Therefore, the correct completion should describe a contrasting state or concept related to the order or sequence, which is ""final"".

Option D, ""first"", is incorrect because it does not describe a contrasting state or concept related to the order or sequence that is analogous to ""quiet"" and ""noisy"".</s>",,E
Opposite,start,stop,trivial,important,famous,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The analogy ""start : stop :: trivial : ?"" suggests that ""start"" and ""stop"" are related in some way, and that ""trivial"" is related to the missing term in the same way. The correct completion is ""important"", because ""start"" and ""stop"" are often used to describe the beginning and end of a process, and ""important"" and ""trivial"" are opposites in terms of significance. However, ""famous"" is not a suitable completion, as there is no clear connection between ""start/stop"" and ""famous/not famous"".</s>",,D
Opposite,laugh,cry,cheap,expensive,inexpensive,"<ans> E </ans>

Explanation:
The correct completion for the analogy ""laugh : cry :: cheap : ?"" is ""inexpensive"".

Opposite,accept,reject,dark,bright,dim,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The correct completion for the analogy ""accept : reject :: dark : ?"" is ""D: bright"". This is because the analogy is stating that ""accept"" is to ""reject"" as ""dark"" is to ""bright"". Therefore, the missing term should be ""bright"" to complete the analogy.

Option E, ""dim"", is not the correct completion because ""dim"" is not the opposite of ""bright"" in the same way that ""reject"" is the opposite of ""accept"".</s>",,D

Opposite,teacher,student,calm,stormy,serene,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The analogy ""teacher : student :: calm : ?"" suggests that the relationship between a teacher and a student is similar to the relationship between calmness and something else. The correct answer is ""stormy"" because a teacher is in control and guides students, while a storm is a disruptive force that can be unpredictable and chaotic. Therefore, the analogy is completed as ""teacher : student :: calm : stormy"".</s>",,D
Opposite,give,take,allow,forbid,permit,"<ans> E </ans>

Explanation:

The correct completion for the analogy ""give : take :: allow : ?"" is ""permit"". The analogy states that ""give"" is to ""take"" as ""allow"" is to ""?"". ""Give"" means to provide something to someone, while ""take"" means to receive something from someone. Similarly, ""allow"" means to give permission for something to happen, while ""permit"" means to give permission. Therefore, the correct completion is ""permit"".</s>",,E
Opposite,clean,dirty,awake,asleep,alert,"<ans> D </ans>

The second term in the analogy, ""sport,"" is a general concept that encompasses many different activities. However, neither ""baseball"" nor ""team"" fully captures the relationship between ""sport"" and ""team"" in the same way that ""shark"" relates to ""fish.""

""Team"" is a more appropriate completion for the analogy because it represents a group of individuals working together towards a common goal, which is a fundamental aspect of many sports.
