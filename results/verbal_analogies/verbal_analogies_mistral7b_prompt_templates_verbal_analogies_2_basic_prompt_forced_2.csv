Explanation:
The analogy ""somber : cheerful :: lawyer :?"" suggests that ""lawyer"" should complete the analogy in a way that is related to ""cheerful"" in the same way that ""somber"" is related to ""cheerful"". The correct answer is ""client"", because a lawyer is typically associated with representing a client, and a client can be somber or cheerful depending on their mood.

Opposite,antonym,synonym,selfish,generous,egocentric,"<ans> D </ans>

Opposite,start,stop,trivial,important,famous,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:
The analogy ""start : stop :: trivial : ?"" suggests that ""start"" and ""stop"" are related in some way to ""trivial"" and the question mark. The correct answer is ""unimportant"" or ""insignificant"", which can be expressed as ""trivial"". Therefore, the answer is ""D: important"" is incorrect, as ""important"" is the opposite of ""trivial"". The correct answer is ""D: unimportant"" or ""D: insignificant"". However, since the analogy uses the word ""trivial"" instead of ""unimportant"" or ""insignificant"", the answer provided in the question is ""D: important"" which is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is ""E: famous"" is also incorrect. The correct answer is ""E: trivial"". However, since the question asks for the completion of the analogy that correctly completes the relationship between ""start"" and ""stop"" and ""trivial"" and the question mark, the answer is ""D: unimportant"" or ""D: insignificant"". Since the analogy uses the word ""trivial"" instead of ""unimportant"" or ""insignificant"", the answer provided in the question is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is ""D: important"" is incorrect. The correct answer is ""D: unimportant"" or ""D: insignificant"". Since the analogy uses the word ""trivial"" instead of ""unimportant"" or ""insignificant"", the answer provided in the question is incorrect.

Explanation:
The analogy ""remember : forget :: increase : ?"" suggests that ""remember"" and ""increase"" are related in some way, as are ""forget"" and ""decrease"" or ""lengthen"". However, the correct answer is ""decrease"". This is because ""remember"" and ""increase"" are related in the sense that remembering something causes it to exist or grow in your mind, while forgetting causes something to decrease or disappear from your mind. Therefore, the correct completion is ""decrease"". ""Lengthen"" is not a valid completion because it does not fit the pattern established by the analogy.</s>",,D
