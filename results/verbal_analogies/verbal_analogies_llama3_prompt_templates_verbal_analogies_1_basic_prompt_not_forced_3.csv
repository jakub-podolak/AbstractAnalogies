Synonym,easy,simple,sad,unhappy,happy,"A nice analogy!

The relationship between ""easy"" and ""simple"" is that both words describe something that is uncomplicated or straightforward. Similarly, the relationship between ""sad"" and the correct completion should be that both words describe a negative emotional state.

""Unhappy"" is a synonym of ""sad"", so it fits the analogy.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,hurry,rush,harm,injure,help,"A nice analogy!

The pattern here is that the first word is a verb, and the second word is a related verb that means to do the first verb more quickly or intensely. For example, ""hurry"" is to ""rush"" as ""harm"" is to...?

In this case, ""harm"" is to ""injure"" as ""hurry"" is to ""rush"", so the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,rob,steal,cry,weep,laugh,"A classic analogy!

The correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The analogy is based on the idea that ""rob"" and ""steal"" are synonyms, and ""cry"" and ""weep"" are also synonyms. Similarly, ""laugh"" is not a synonym of ""cry"", so it doesn't fit the pattern.

Well, that was easy!",,D
Synonym,polite,courteous,angry,furious,happy,"A nice analogy!

The relationship between ""polite"" and ""courteous"" is that they are synonyms, both describing a polite or respectful manner.

If we apply this relationship to the analogy, we can see that ""angry"" and ""furious"" are also synonyms, both describing a strong feeling of anger.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,beginner,novice,doctor,physician,heal,"A nice analogy!

The relationship between ""beginner"" and ""novice"" is that they are both terms for someone who is new to a particular field or activity. Similarly, the relationship between ""doctor"" and ""physician"" is that they are both terms for a medical professional.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,baby,infant,woman,lady,girl,"A nice analogy!

The relationship between ""baby"" and ""infant"" is that ""baby"" is a more general term that encompasses ""infant"", which is a more specific term.

Similarly, ""woman"" is a more general term that encompasses ""lady"", which is a more specific term.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,brook,stream,courage,bravery,cowardice,"A nice analogy!

The relationship between ""brook"" and ""stream"" is that a brook is a smaller or narrower stream. This suggests that the analogy is comparing a smaller or more specific form of something to the more general term.

In this case, ""courage"" is a more general term, and ""bravery"" is a specific form of courage. Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,huge,enormous,wealthy,rich,poor,"A nice analogy!

The relationship between ""huge"" and ""enormous"" is that both words describe something as very large. Similarly, the relationship between ""wealthy"" and the correct completion should be that both words describe someone as having a lot of money.

In this case, ""rich"" is a synonym for ""wealthy"", so the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,cheerful,happy,awful,horrible,wonderful,"A delightful analogy!

The pattern here is that the first word is an adjective that describes a positive emotion, and the second word is the emotion itself. Therefore, if ""cheerful"" is to ""happy"" like ""awful"" is to...?

The correct completion is ""horrible"", as ""awful"" is an adjective that describes a negative emotion, and ""horrible"" is the emotion itself.

So, the correct answer is: <ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,remain,stay,begin,start,continue,"A nice analogy!

The relationship between ""remain"" and ""stay"" is that ""remain"" is a verb that means to stay or continue to be in a place or state, and ""stay"" is a verb that means to remain in a place or state.

Similarly, the relationship between ""begin"" and the correct completion is that ""begin"" is a verb that means to start or initiate something, and the correct completion should be a verb that means to start or initiate something.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,unusual,strange,famous,renowned,unknown,"A nice analogy!

The relationship between ""unusual"" and ""strange"" is that they both describe something that is not typical or normal. Therefore, the correct completion for ""famous"" should be a word that describes something that is well-known or widely recognized.

""Renowned"" fits this description, as it means famous or well-known, especially for something that is considered to be of high quality or achievement.

On the other hand, ""unknown"" doesn't quite fit, as it means not well-known or recognized, which is the opposite of what we're looking for.

So, the correct answer is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,sick,ill,little,small,big,"A nice analogy!

The analogy is comparing two pairs of words that are related in a similar way. In the first pair, ""sick"" and ""ill"" are both words that describe a state of being unwell. In the second pair, we need to find a word that is related to ""little"" in a similar way.

After analyzing the analogy, I think I have the correct answer:

The word ""little"" is an adjective that means ""small in size or amount"", so the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The word ""small"" is the one that is related to ""little"" in the same way that ""ill"" is related to ""sick"".",,D
Synonym,legal,lawful,usual,normal,strange,"A nice analogy!

The relationship between ""legal"" and ""lawful"" is that they are synonyms. Both words refer to something that is in accordance with the law.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,collect,gather,leave,abandon,stay,"A nice analogy!

The relationship between ""collect"" and ""gather"" is that both verbs mean to bring together or accumulate something. Therefore, the correct completion would be a verb that means to depart or go away from something.

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,clean,neat,fortunate,lucky,miserable,"A nice analogy!

The relationship between ""clean"" and ""neat"" is that both words describe a state of tidiness or orderliness. Similarly, the relationship between ""fortunate"" and the correct completion should be that both words describe a state of good luck or prosperity.

""Lucky"" fits this description, as it is a synonym of ""fortunate"". On the other hand, ""miserable"" is an antonym of ""fortunate"", describing a state of unhappiness or bad luck.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,immense,colossal,precise,exact,approximate,"A nice analogy!

The relationship between ""immense"" and ""colossal"" is that they are both superlatives used to describe something as extremely large or impressive. Therefore, the correct completion should also be a superlative adjective that describes something as extremely precise.

""Exact"" is a superlative adjective that means extremely precise or accurate, whereas ""approximate"" is the opposite, meaning not precise or accurate.

So, the correct answer is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,stone,rock,garbage,trash,bag,"A nice analogy!

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,help,aid,raise,lift,lower,"A nice analogy!

The relationship between ""help"" and ""aid"" is that ""aid"" is a type of ""help"". Similarly, the relationship between ""raise"" and the correct completion should be that the correct completion is a type of ""raise"".

""Lift"" is a type of ""raise"", as in ""to lift someone's spirits"" or ""to lift a weight"". On the other hand, ""lower"" is not a type of ""raise"", but rather the opposite.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,rug,carpet,bucket,pail,milk,"A nice analogy!

The pattern here is that both ""rug"" and ""carpet"" are types of floor coverings, so we're looking for a similar relationship between ""bucket"" and its completion.

A bucket is a type of container, and a pail is a type of container, so the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,shout,yell,leap,jump,fall,"A nice analogy!

The relationship between ""shout"" and ""yell"" is that they are both forms of loud or intense speaking. Similarly, the relationship between ""leap"" and the correct completion should be that they are both forms of sudden or energetic movement.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Opposite,love,hate,rich,poor,wealthy,"A classic analogy!

The correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The analogy is based on the opposition between two emotions (love and hate) and two economic states (rich and poor).

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Opposite,late,early,win,lose,capture,"A nice analogy!

The relationship between ""late"" and ""early"" is one of opposition or contrast. ""Late"" is the opposite of ""early"".

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Opposite,quick,slow,grow,wither,plant,"A nice analogy!

The pattern here is that the first word is an action, and the second word is the result of that action. In other words, ""quick"" is the result of ""growing"" (fast), and ""slow"" is the result of ""growing"" (not fast).

Applying this pattern to the second part of the analogy, we get:

grow :? :: quick : slow

The correct result of ""growing"" is ""plant"", not ""wither"". Wither is the opposite of growing, whereas plant is the result of growing.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> E </ans>",,E
Opposite,antonym,synonym,selfish,generous,egocentric,"The analogy is comparing antonyms and synonyms, and the relationship between them is one of opposition or similarity.

Similarly, the relationship between strong and [something] is also one of opposition, where strong is the opposite of [something].

Weak is the correct completion because it is the opposite of strong, just like coward is the opposite of hero.

Muscular is not the correct completion because it is not the opposite of strong. In fact, muscular is often associated with being strong!",,D
