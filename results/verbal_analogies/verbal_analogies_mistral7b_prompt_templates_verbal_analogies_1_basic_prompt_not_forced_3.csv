Synonym,easy,simple,sad,unhappy,happy,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation: The analogy ""easy : simple :: sad : ?"" requires completing the analogy with a term that is related to ""sad"" in the same way that ""simple"" is related to ""easy"". The term ""unhappy"" or ""D"" is the correct completion as ""simple"" is often used to describe things that are easy to understand or do, and ""unhappy"" or ""sad"" are related in that they both describe emotional states that are not positive. The term ""happy"" or ""E"" is not the correct completion as ""happy"" is not related to ""sad"" in the same way that ""simple"" is related to ""easy"".</s>",,D
Synonym,hurry,rush,harm,injure,help,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The analogy ""hurry : rush :: harm : ?"" suggests that just as rush is related to hurry, harm is related to the missing term with the same relationship. The word ""rush"" implies a sense of urgency or haste, while ""hurry"" is the action or state of moving quickly. Similarly, ""harm"" implies causing injury or damage, while the missing term should also imply causing some sort of negative effect. Therefore, the correct completion is ""injure"" (D). The other option, ""help,"" does not fit the analogy as it implies a positive effect rather than a negative one.</s>",,D
Synonym,rob,steal,cry,weep,laugh,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation: The analogy ""rob : steal :: cry : ?"" suggests that ""rob"" and ""steal"" are related in the same way that ""cry"" and ""?"" are related.

Synonym,brook,stream,courage,bravery,cowardice,"<ans> D </ans>

Therefore, the final analogy should read as ""brook : stream :: courage : bravery"".</s>",,D
Synonym,huge,enormous,wealthy,rich,poor,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:
The analogy ""huge : enormous :: wealthy : ?"" should be completed with a term that maintains the relationship between the first two terms (size) with the second two terms (wealth).

Synonym,cheerful,happy,awful,horrible,wonderful,"<ans> D </ans>

Synonym,remain,stay,begin,start,continue,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation: The analogy ""remain : stay :: begin : ?"" suggests that ""remain"" and ""stay"" are related in the same way that ""begin"" and ""?"" are related. The correct completion is ""D: start"" because ""stay"" is the opposite of ""begin"", and ""remain"" is the opposite of ""finish"" or ""end"". Therefore, the correct completion is ""D: start"" because ""remain"" is like ""begin"" in the sense that both are opposites of ""finish"" or ""end"".</s>",,D

Therefore, the correct completion for the analogy ""usual : ?"" should also mean something that conforms to a common practice or is authorized by a social norm. The answer is ""normal"" because it is a term that describes something that conforms to a common practice or is generally expected.</s>",,D
Synonym,collect,gather,leave,abandon,stay,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The analogy ""help : aid :: raise : ?"" is stating that help is to aid, and raise is to something. In this context, the correct answer is ""lift"" because help and aid are synonymous in the sense of providing assistance, and raise and lift are synonymous in the sense of making something higher. Therefore, the correct completion is ""lift"" (D). The alternative completion ""lower"" (E) is incorrect because it does not fit the pattern of the analogy.</s>",,D
Synonym,rug,carpet,bucket,pail,milk,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The second part of the analogy, ""bucket : ?"", suggests a relationship between a bucket (a container) and something else. The relationship is not clear without additional context.

Completion D, ""pail"", is a type of container similar to a bucket. It is a reasonable completion because it maintains the relationship of containers in the analogy.

Completion E, ""milk"", does not maintain the relationship of the analogy. Milk is a liquid, not a container. Therefore, it is not the correct completion.</s>",,D
Synonym,shout,yell,leap,jump,fall,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The analogy ""shout : yell :: leap : ?"" suggests that ""shout"" and ""yell"" are two ways of making loud noises, while ""leap"" and the missing term are two ways of moving. The correct answer is ""jump"" because both ""leap"" and ""jump"" are ways of moving that involve lifting one's body off the ground.</s>",,D
Opposite,artificial,natural,friend,enemy,relative,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation: The correct completion for the analogy ""artificial : natural :: friend : ?"" is ""enemy"". The analogy compares two pairs of concepts: ""artificial"" and ""natural"" and ""friend"" and the missing term.

Explanation: The analogy ""somber : cheerful :: lawyer : ?"" suggests that there is a relationship between ""somber"" and ""cheerful"" that is similar to the relationship between ""lawyer"" and the missing term. The correct answer is ""client"", as a lawyer represents and advises a client, who may be somber or cheerful, much like how someone's mood can be contrasted with cheerfulness. The ""doctor"" analogy does not fit as well, as a doctor typically does not have a direct relationship with someone's mood in the same way a lawyer has with their client.</s>",,D
Opposite,late,early,win,lose,capture,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation: The analogy ""late : early :: win : ?"" suggests that just as ""late"" is to ""early"" in terms of time, ""win"" is to something else in terms of outcome. The correct answer is ""lose"", as the analogy implies that ""win"" is the opposite of the missing term.</s>",,D
Opposite,quick,slow,grow,wither,plant,"<ans> D </ans>

The correct analogy is: ""quick is to slow, like grow is to wither."" This analogy suggests that just as quick is the opposite of slow, grow is the opposite of wither.

Opposite,antonym,synonym,selfish,generous,egocentric,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The analogy ""antonym : synonym :: selfish : ?"" is stating that antonym and synonym are related in the same way that selfish and the missing term are related.

An antonym is a word that has the opposite meaning of another word. A synonym, on the other hand, is a word that has the same or nearly the same meaning as another word.

Therefore, the missing term should be a word that is the opposite of selfish, which is ""generous"".

So, the correct analogy is: ""antonym : synonym :: selfish : generous"".</s>",,D
Opposite,quiet,noisy,last,first,final,"<ans> E </ans>

Explanation:

The analogy ""quiet : noisy :: last : ?"" is saying that quiet is to noisy in the same way that last is to something. The correct answer is ""final"". Quiet is to noisy as last is to final because quiet is the absence of noise, just as last is the final item in a sequence.</s>",,E
Opposite,start,stop,trivial,important,famous,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation: The analogy ""start : stop :: trivial : ?"" suggests that ""start"" and ""stop"" are related in some way to ""trivial"" and ""?"". A correct completion would be a concept that is related to ""trivial"" in the same way that ""stop"" is related to ""start"".

Opposite,abundant,scarce,agree,disagree,concur,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation: The analogy ""abundant : scarce :: agree : ?"" requires that the second pair of terms (scarce and agree/concur) have a relationship similar to the first pair of terms (abundant and scarce). Since ""agree"" means having the same opinion or viewpoint, and ""disagree"" means having opposite or differing opinions, the correct completion is ""disagree"" because it maintains the relationship of opposites that is present in the first pair of terms.</s>",,D
Opposite,hero,coward,strong,weak,muscular,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation: The analogy ""hero : coward :: strong : ?"" requires that the relationship between ""hero"" and ""coward"" be parallel to the relationship between ""strong"" and ""?"".

This is because ""give"" and ""take"" are related to each other in the context of transferring something from one person to another. Similarly, ""allow"" and ""permit"" are related to each other in the context of giving permission for something to happen. Therefore, the correct completion is ""permit"" or ""E"".</s>",,E
Opposite,clean,dirty,awake,asleep,alert,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation: The analogy ""clean : dirty :: awake : ?"" is comparing two pairs of concepts. The first pair, ""clean : dirty"", describes a state of being free from dirt or impurities.
