Synonym,easy,simple,sad,unhappy,happy,"The analogy ""easy : simple :: sad :?"" means that ""easy"" is to ""simple"" in the same way that ""sad"" is to the missing term.

The correct answer is:

<ans> D: unhappy </ans>

Explanation:
The analogy ""easy : simple"" suggests that ""simple"" is a property or characteristic of ""easy."" In the same way, ""unhappy"" is a property or characteristic of ""sad."" Therefore, the missing term should be ""unhappy.""</s>",,D
Synonym,hurry,rush,harm,injure,help,"The analogy ""hurry : rush :: harm :?"" suggests that there is a relationship between the pairs (hurry, rush) and (harm, ?). In the first pair, ""hurry"" is related to ""rush"" in some way, and in the second pair, ""harm"" is related to the question mark ""?"".

To understand the relationship, let's analyze the given pairs:

1. Hurry and rush are related in the sense that hurrying is a way of rushing. When you hurry, you are trying to do something as quickly as possible, and rushing is also a state of moving quickly.
2. Harm and the question mark ""?"" are related in the sense that harm is a way of causing something. However, the analogy does not provide enough context to determine what ""?"" could be.

Now, let's consider the given completions:

1. D: injure
2. E: help

The completion ""injure"" does not fit the analogy because hurrying and rushing are not typically associated with causing injury. Instead, they are related to moving quickly.

On the other hand, the completion ""help"" does not fit the analogy because helping and causing harm are not related concepts. Helping is an action that benefits someone, while causing harm is an action that harms or injures someone.

Therefore, the correct completion for the analogy is:

<ans> D: injure </ans>

(This is incorrect, the correct answer is D: harm)

However, based on the given context and the relationship between the pairs (hurry, rush) and (harm, ?), the correct completion should be:

<ans> D: harm </ans>

Explanation:
The analogy ""hurry : rush :: harm : ?"" suggests that there is a relationship between the pairs (hurry, rush) and (harm, ?). In the first pair, hurrying is a way of rushing, and in the second pair, harm is a way of causing something. Therefore, the correct completion for the analogy is ""harm"".</s>","<ans> D </ans>

Explanation: The analogy ""hurry : rush :: harm : ?"" suggests that there is a relationship between the pairs (hurry, rush) and (harm, ?). In the first pair, hurrying is a way of rushing, and in the second pair, harm is a way of causing something. Therefore, the correct completion for the analogy is ""harm"".</s>",D
Synonym,rob,steal,cry,weep,laugh,"The analogy ""rob : steal :: cry :?"" suggests that ""rob"" and ""steal"" are related in the same way that ""cry"" and ""?"" are related. ""Rob"" and ""steal"" are both related to taking something from someone without permission. Therefore, the thing that ""cry"" is related to should also be something that is expressed or done without permission, but is an emotional response rather than a physical action. The correct answer is:

<ans> D: weep </ans>

Explanation:
The word ""weep"" is the correct answer because it is an emotional response that is often expressed without permission, such as in a public place or during a sad moment. It is related to crying in the same way that stealing is related to robbing.</s>",,D
Synonym,polite,courteous,angry,furious,happy,"Polite and courteous are behaviors that are considered friendly and respectful. Angry and furious are both emotions that indicate strong negative feelings. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Synonym,beginner,novice,doctor,physician,heal,"The analogy ""beginner : novice :: doctor :?"" suggests that a beginner is to novice as a doctor is to something. In other words, a beginner is a type of novice, and a doctor is a type of something.

Let's consider the completions:

D: physician

This completion suggests that a doctor is a type of physician. However, a doctor is already a type of doctor, so this completion doesn't make sense in the context of the analogy.

E: heal

This completion suggests that a doctor is like someone who heals. This is a valid completion because a doctor is someone who heals people.

Synonym,baby,infant,woman,lady,girl,"The analogy ""baby : infant :: woman :?"" means that a baby is to an infant as a woman is to?. In other words, a baby is a younger form of an infant, and a woman is a grown-up version of a girl or a lady. Therefore, the answer is:

<ans> D: lady </ans>

Explanation:
A baby is to an infant as a woman is to a lady. A baby is the younger form of an infant, and a lady is the grown-up version of a woman. Therefore, the correct answer is D: lady.

Alternatively, you could also say that a woman is to a girl, but the analogy specifically asks for the grown-up version, which is why the answer is D: lady.

Therefore, the answer is <ans> D: lady </ans>.</s>",<ans> D </ans></s>,D
Synonym,brook,stream,courage,bravery,cowardice,"A brook is a type of stream, so we're looking for a quality or concept that is related to courage in the same way that a brook is related to a stream. The answer is:

<ans> D: bravery </ans>

Explanation:
A brook is a small stream, and a stream is a body of flowing water. Courage is a quality of mind or spirit that enables a person to face difficulty, danger, or pain, while bravery is the quality of being brave. So, just as a brook is a type of stream, courage is a type of bravery.</s>",,D
Synonym,huge,enormous,wealthy,rich,poor,"The analogy ""huge : enormous :: wealthy :?"" means that ""huge"" is to ""enormous"" in the same way that ""wealthy"" is to something.

We know that ""huge"" means very large and ""enormous"" means extremely large. So we need to find a term that is related to ""wealthy"" in the same way that ""enormous"" is related to ""huge"".

The term ""rich"" could be a correct answer because being rich means having a great deal of money or resources, which is a larger amount than being merely wealthy.

However, the term ""poor"" is not a correct answer because being poor means having little or no money or resources, which is a smaller amount than being wealthy.

Therefore, the answer is: <ans> D: rich </ans></s>",,D
Synonym,cheerful,happy,awful,horrible,wonderful,"<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

In the given analogy, ""cheerful"" is related to ""happy"" in the same way that ""awful"" is related to ""?"".

We know that ""cheerful"" means happy and joyful, and ""happy"" means feeling or showing pleasure or contentment.

So, we need to find a word that is the opposite of ""happy"" and is related to ""awful"" in the same way.

The word ""horrible"" fits this description as it is the opposite of ""happy"" and is related to ""awful"" in the sense that both words convey a strong feeling of displeasure or fear.</s>",,D
Synonym,remain,stay,begin,start,continue,"The analogy ""remain : stay :: begin :?"" suggests that ""remain"" and ""stay"" are related in some way, as are ""begin"" and the missing term.

The first pair, ""remain"" and ""stay,"" can be understood as meaning to continue in the same state or position. For example, if you remain in a room, you don't leave it, and if you stay in a place, you don't go anywhere.

The second pair, ""begin"" and the missing term, should also be related in this way. The correct answer is:

<ans> D: start </ans>

Explanation:
The term that completes the analogy should mean to start or initiate an action, just as ""remain"" and ""stay"" mean to continue in the same state. Therefore, the answer is ""start,"" not ""continue."" While ""continue"" is related to ""remain"" and ""stay,"" it does not correctly complete the analogy with ""begin.""</s>",,D
Synonym,unusual,strange,famous,renowned,unknown,"The analogy ""unusual : strange :: famous :?"" is comparing two pairs of words. The first pair, ""unusual : strange,"" suggests a relationship of synonymy or near-synonymy, where ""unusual"" means not typical or common, and ""strange"" means unusual or extraordinary in a way that might be disconcerting or intriguing.

The second pair, ""famous : ?"" should complete the analogy in a way that makes the relationship between ""famous"" and the missing term parallel to the relationship between ""unusual"" and ""strange.""

The answer is D: renowned. The word ""renowned"" means widely known and respected, which is a positive and desirable quality that is the opposite of ""unusual"" in the same way that ""strange"" is the opposite of ""famous.""

Therefore, the answer is: <ans> D </ans>

Explanation:
The word ""unknown"" does not complete the analogy correctly. While ""strange"" and ""unknown"" may be related in some contexts, they are not perfect synonyms or antonyms. ""Unknown"" means not known or unidentified, which is not the opposite of ""famous"" in the same way that ""strange"" is the opposite of ""unusual.""</s>",,D

Explanation:
The relationship between ""sick"" and ""ill"" is one of synonymy or near-synonymy - they mean roughly the same thing. The relationship between ""little"" and ""small"" is also one of synonymy or near-synonymy - they mean roughly the same thing. Therefore, the correct completion is ""small"".</s>",,D
Synonym,legal,lawful,usual,normal,strange,"<ans> D </ans>

Synonym,collect,gather,leave,abandon,stay,"The analogy ""collect : gather :: leave :?"" suggests that ""collect"" and ""gather"" are two actions related to bringing or accumulating things, while ""leave"" and the missing word are related to being present or absent. Based on this context, the correct completion is:

<ans> D: abandon </ans>

Explanation:
The word ""abandon"" means to give up or leave something behind. In the context of the analogy, ""leave"" is related to ""abandon"" because leaving something implies giving it up or abandoning it. Therefore, the correct completion is ""abandon"".

The word ""stay"" does not fit the analogy because it means to remain or be present, which is not related to the idea of leaving or abandoning something.</s>",,D
Synonym,clean,neat,fortunate,lucky,miserable,"The analogy ""clean : neat :: fortunate :?"" suggests that ""clean"" and ""neat"" are related in some way, and that ""fortunate"" and the missing term are also related. The relationship between ""clean"" and ""neat"" is one of synonymy or similar meaning - a clean space is also neat, and a neat space is also clean.

The relationship between ""fortunate"" and the missing term is not immediately clear, but we can consider some possibilities based on the given analogy. One possibility is that ""fortunate"" and the missing term are also related in meaning, with ""fortunate"" suggesting good luck or success, and the missing term suggesting something positive and desirable.

Option D, ""lucky,"" is a good fit for this analogy. Being fortunate and being lucky both suggest good fortune or success. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Synonym,immense,colossal,precise,exact,approximate,"The analogy ""immense : colossal :: precise : ?"" suggests that ""immense"" and ""colossal"" are both large or vast, while ""precise"" implies a high degree of accuracy or exactness.

Option D, ""exact,"" is the correct answer. It completes the analogy by indicating that just as ""immense"" and ""colossal"" are both large, ""precise"" and ""exact"" are both related to accuracy.

Therefore, the final answer is: <ans> D </ans></s>",,D
Synonym,stone,rock,garbage,trash,bag,"In the given analogy, ""stone : rock"" is a part-whole relationship where a stone is a type of rock. Therefore, we need to find a part-whole relationship for ""garbage : ?"".

Synonym,help,aid,raise,lift,lower,"The analogy ""help : aid :: raise :?"" suggests that ""help"" and ""aid"" are interchangeable in the first part of the analogy, and ""raise"" and the missing term in the second part are interchangeable.

The correct answer is:
<ans> D: lift </ans>

Explanation:
The word ""lift"" is a synonym for ""raise"" in the context of this analogy. Therefore, the missing term should be ""lift"" to complete the analogy.

So, the completed analogy is: ""help : aid :: raise : lift"".

Therefore, the answer is <ans> D: lift </ans>.

The answer E: lower is incorrect because ""lower"" is not a synonym for ""raise"" in this context.</s>",<ans> D </ans></s>,D
Synonym,rug,carpet,bucket,pail,milk,"The analogy ""rug : carpet :: bucket :?"" suggests that a rug is to a carpet as a bucket is to something. This means that rugs and carpets are related in some way, and buckets and the missing term are also related in the same way.

A rug and a carpet are both types of floor coverings. They serve similar purposes, but rugs are typically smaller and can be moved around more easily than carpets.

A bucket and a pail are both containers used to hold liquids or other materials. They are similar in size and shape, but a pail is often larger than a bucket.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> D: pail </ans>

Explanation:
The analogy suggests that rugs and carpets are related in the same way that buckets and pails are related. Since rugs are smaller and more portable than carpets, and buckets are smaller than pails, the missing term should be ""pail"" to complete the analogy.</s>",,D
Synonym,shout,yell,leap,jump,fall,"The analogy ""shout : yell :: leap :?"" suggests that ""shout"" and ""yell"" are similar in some way, as are ""leap"" and the missing term.

The correct answer is:
<ans> D: jump </ans>

Explanation:
The word ""yell"" is often used interchangeably with ""shout,"" and both words refer to making a loud, forceful utterance. Similarly, ""leap"" and ""jump"" are related actions, with a leap being a more dramatic or longer jump.</s>",,D
Opposite,artificial,natural,friend,enemy,relative,"In the given analogy, ""artificial"" is compared to ""natural"" using the colon and the double colon. This means that just like artificial things are to natural things, the blank should be filled with something that is related in a similar way to the second term in the second pair.

Let's consider the options:

Option D: enemy
Option E: relative

The term ""enemy"" is not related to ""friend"" in the same way that ""artificial"" is related to ""natural"". While ""artificial"" and ""natural"" are opposites, ""friend"" and ""enemy"" are not directly related in the same way.

On the other hand, ""relative"" is related to ""friend"" in a similar way to how ""natural"" is related to ""artificial"". Just as ""natural"" is the opposite or counterpart of ""artificial"", ""relative"" is a term that can be used to describe a relationship or connection between ""friend"" and other people.

Option E: relative.</s>",,E
Opposite,love,hate,rich,poor,wealthy,"Love and hate are two opposing emotions. Therefore, the correct completion for the analogy would be:

Explanation:
The analogy ""love : hate"" suggests a relationship of opposites. The emotion of love is typically associated with positive feelings, while hate is associated with negative feelings. Similarly, the analogy ""rich : ?"" suggests a relationship of opposites as well. The term ""rich"" is associated with having an abundance of resources or wealth, while the blank should be filled with a term that is the opposite of wealth. The term ""poor"" fits this description, as it is the opposite of being rich in terms of resources or wealth. Therefore, the correct completion for the analogy is ""D: poor"".</s>",,D
Opposite,alive,dead,succeed,fail,conquer,"In this analogy, ""alive : dead"" represents a contrast between two states, where ""alive"" is the active, living state, and ""dead"" is the inactive, non-living state.

The second part of the analogy, ""succeed : ?"" is also meant to represent a contrast between two states or outcomes. Since ""succeed"" implies a positive outcome, the question mark should represent a negative outcome.

Therefore, the correct completion for the analogy would be:

<ans> D: fail </ans>

Explanation:
The analogy ""alive : dead :: succeed : ?"" is meant to show that ""alive"" is to ""dead"" as ""succeed"" is to something that is not succeeded. Since ""fail"" is the opposite of ""succeed,"" it is the correct completion for the analogy.</s>",,D
Opposite,ugliness,beauty,joy,sorrow,emotion,"Ugliness is to beauty as joy is to what? Let's break down the analogy:

1. Ugliness and beauty are opposites in terms of attractiveness.

Now, let's consider the options:

Option D: sorrow
Sorrow is an emotion, but it's not the opposite of joy. Joy and sorrow are complementary emotions, not opposites.

Option E: emotion
Emotion is a broad category that includes both joy and sorrow. However, the analogy asks for the emotion that is the opposite of joy.

Opposite,huge,tiny,arrive,depart,come,"The analogy ""huge : tiny :: arrive :?"" suggests that ""huge"" and ""tiny"" are related in the same way that ""arrive"" and ""?"" are related.

The relationship between ""huge"" and ""tiny"" is one of contrast, with ""huge"" being much larger than ""tiny"".

The word ""arrive"" means to come to a place or arrive at a destination. However, the relationship between ""arrive"" and the missing word is not one of contrast like ""huge"" and ""tiny"". Instead, the relationship is one of completion or arrival.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> D: depart </ans>

Explanation:
The word ""depart"" is the opposite of ""arrive"". While ""arrive"" means to come to a place, ""depart"" means to leave a place. This completes the analogy, as ""huge"" and ""tiny"" are contrasting sizes, and ""arrive"" and ""depart"" are contrasting actions.</s>",,D
Opposite,somber,cheerful,lawyer,client,doctor,"In the given analogy, ""somber"" is compared to ""cheerful"" using the colon (:) symbol, which indicates a relationship between the two. The relationship is further described as being similar to the relationship between ""lawyer"" and ""?"".

To understand the relationship between ""lawyer"" and ""?"" we need to consider what role a lawyer plays in relation to a client. A lawyer represents and advises a client in legal matters. The client is the person or entity who seeks the legal services of the lawyer.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> D: client </ans></s>",,D
Opposite,late,early,win,lose,capture,"In the given analogy, ""late"" is compared to ""early"" using the colon (:) symbol, and ""win"" is compared to the question mark using the same symbol. This means that we are looking for a term that is related to ""win"" in the same way that ""early"" is related to ""late"".

The term ""lose"" can be considered the opposite of ""win"", so it is a plausible completion for the analogy. However, the term ""capture"" can also be considered related to ""win"" in certain contexts, such as in a game or competition.

To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the relationship between ""late"" and ""early"" in the analogy. ""Late"" can be thought of as the opposite of ""early"" in terms of time. Therefore, the term that is the opposite of ""win"" in the same sense would be the correct completion for the analogy.

Generous and selfish are antonyms. Generous means willing to give or share; kind and generous. Selfish means concerned primarily with one's own interests.

E: egocentric

Egocentric and selfish are related but not exactly the same. Egocentric means having an exaggerated sense of self-importance and self-centeredness. Selfish means concerned primarily with one's own interests.

Opposite,start,stop,trivial,important,famous,"In the given analogy, ""start"" is related to ""stop"" as ""trivial"" is related to ""?"". The relationship between ""start"" and ""stop"" is that of opposites - one starts an action and the other stops it.

Now, let's consider the options:

D: important
E: famous

The relationship between ""trivial"" and ""important"" is not that of opposites. ""Trivial"" means something is unimportant or of little consequence, while ""important"" means something is significant or has great value.

On the other hand, the relationship between ""trivial"" and ""famous"" is not a clear-cut analogy. ""Famous"" means well-known or renowned, while ""trivial"" means unimportant or of little consequence. These two concepts don't have a direct opposite relationship.

Therefore, the answer is:
<ans> D: important </ans> is incorrect.

The correct answer is:
<ans> E: unimportant </ans> or <ans> E: insignificant </ans>

Explanation:
The relationship between ""start"" and ""stop"" is that of opposites, and the relationship between ""trivial"" and the correct answer should also be that of opposites. Since ""trivial"" means unimportant or of little consequence, the correct answer should be ""unimportant"" or ""insignificant"".

The first pair describes emotions, with laugh being a positive emotion and cry being a negative one. The second pair describes prices, with cheap being a lower price and ? being an unknown price.

Based on the given options, the correct answer is:

<ans> D: expensive </ans>

The reason is that the relationship between laugh and cry is opposite in nature, with laugh being a positive emotion and cry being a negative one. Similarly, the relationship between cheap and expensive is opposite in nature, with cheap being a lower price and expensive being a higher price. Therefore, the missing part of the analogy should be ""expensive"".</s>",,D

Explanation:
A coward is someone who lacks courage or is afraid, while a hero is someone who exhibits courage and bravery.

Opposite,teacher,student,calm,stormy,serene,"The analogy ""teacher : student :: calm : ?"" suggests that the relationship between a teacher and a student is similar to the relationship between calmness and something else.

The first part of the analogy, ""teacher : student,"" describes a relationship where the teacher is in a position of authority and guidance, while the student is in a position of learning and growth.

The second part of the analogy, ""calm : ?,"" suggests that calmness is a state of tranquility or peace, and the question mark represents something else that is related to this state.

Based on this information, the correct completion for the analogy would be:

Explanation:
The analogy ""give : take :: allow : ?"" suggests that ""give"" and ""allow"" are actions that provide or enable something, while ""take"" and the missing term are actions that remove or restrict something. Therefore, the missing term should be an action that permits or enables, making the correct answer ""permit"".

Alternative explanation:
The analogy ""give : take :: allow : ?"" can be understood as ""give"" and ""allow"" being actions that grant or bestow something, while ""take"" and the missing term are actions that remove or deny something.

Similarly, ""ride"" is an activity that can be associated with ""rider"" because a person rides a vehicle or an animal, such as a horse. However, the analogy asks for the completion that is most similar to ""song"" in relation to ""ride"". Since a horse is a vehicle for transportation, it is more directly related to ""ride"" than a ""rider"" is. Therefore, the correct answer is <ans> D: horse </ans>.

Therefore, the answer is <ans> D: horse </ans>.</s>",<ans> D </ans></s>,D
Function,hear,ear,wear,clothes,woman,"The analogy ""hear : ear :: wear :?"" suggests that ""hear"" and ""ear"" are related in the same way that ""wear"" and ""?"" are related.

The relationship between ""hear"" and ""ear"" is that of an action and the organ that performs the action, respectively. Therefore, the missing part of the analogy should be an object or a type of clothing that is worn.

Hence, the answer is:

<ans> D: clothes </ans></s>",,D
Function,drive,car,burn,wood,fire,"The analogy ""drive : car :: burn :?"" suggests that ""drive"" and ""car"" are related in some way, and that ""burn"" and the missing term are also related. The relationship between ""drive"" and ""car"" is that of an action and the object that performs that action. Therefore, the missing term should be something that can be burned.

Option D, ""wood,"" is a good choice because wood is a common material that can be burned. Option E, ""fire,"" is also a good choice because fire is the result of burning. However, since the analogy asks for the term that is burned, the correct answer is D: wood.

Function,open,door,touch,hands,doctor,"In the given analogy, ""open : door"" is a relationship where opening refers to making something accessible or ready to use by acting upon it. Similarly, ""touch : ?"" is also a relationship where touch refers to making contact with something.

The correct completion for the analogy would be something that also refers to making contact with something when in contact with a door. The answer is:

<ans> D: hands </ans>

Explanation: Hands are used to touch things and open doors. Therefore, the correct completion is D.

Option E, ""doctor,"" is not a correct completion as a doctor is not related to making contact with a door in the same way that hands are related to opening a door and making contact with it.</s>",,D
Function,squeeze,juice,shoot,gun,miss,"In the given analogy, ""squeeze : juice"" is compared to ""shoot : ?"". The first part of the analogy, ""squeeze : juice"", means that squeezing produces juice. Therefore, the second part of the analogy should also involve an action that produces a result.

Let's consider the options:

D: gun

This option does not fit the analogy as shooting a gun does not produce a result that is directly comparable to juice.

E: miss

This option is more likely to be correct as missing a target is like not producing juice when you squeeze. In both cases, an expected result is not achieved.

Function,cut,knife,hit,hammer,nail,"In the given analogy, ""cut"" is related to ""knife"" in the same way that ""hit"" is related to ""?"". The relationship between ""cut"" and ""knife"" is that of an action and the tool used to perform that action.

Similarly, ""hit"" is an action, and we need to find the tool or instrument that is used to perform that action. The correct answer is:

<ans> D: hammer </ans>

Explanation: A hammer is an instrument used to perform the action of hitting.</s>",,D
Function,throw,ball,open,envelope,close,"The analogy ""throw : ball :: open : ?"" suggests that ""throw"" and ""open"" are related in some way, and ""ball"" and ""envelope"" or ""close"" are related in another way.

The verb ""throw"" implies an action that is forceful and sends an object through the air. The noun ""ball"" is an object that is commonly thrown.

The verb ""open"" implies an action that makes something accessible or reveals its contents. The noun ""envelope"" is an object that can be opened to reveal its contents.

Therefore, the correct completion for the analogy is:

Function,read,magazine,play,football,kids,"In the given analogy, ""read"" is related to ""magazine"" in the same way that ""play"" is related to ""?"". The analogy suggests that ""play"" should be related to something that can be engaged with for an extended period of time and provides enjoyment or entertainment. Based on this, the correct answer is:

<ans> D: football </ans>

Explanation:
Football is a game that can be engaged with for an extended period of time and provides enjoyment or entertainment, similar to how reading a magazine can provide enjoyment and information for an extended period of time.

Alternative answer:

Explanation:
While kids can provide enjoyment and entertainment, they are not directly related to the concept of engaging with something for an extended period of time in the same way that reading a magazine or playing a game is.</s>",<ans> D </ans></s>,D
Function,carry,suitcase,sit,chair,job,"In the given analogy, ""carry : suitcase"" is a relationship of containing or transporting. The second relationship ""sit : ?"" is also related to actions, but it's not clear what the missing part ""?"" represents.

Let's consider the options:

D: chair
This option doesn't make much sense in the context of the analogy. Carrying a suitcase and sitting on a chair are two unrelated actions.

E: job
This option seems more plausible. Just as a person can carry a suitcase (perform a task), they can also have a job (perform a role or set of tasks).

Function,drink,glass,cook,pan,chef,"In the given analogy, ""drink"" is related to ""glass"" in the same way that ""cook"" is related to ""?"".

A glass is used to contain a drink. Therefore, the answer should be something that is used to contain or prepare food for cooking.

Let's examine the options:

D. pan
A pan is a large, flat-bottomed container used for cooking. It fits the description perfectly.

E. chef
A chef is a person who prepares, cooks, and presents food. While chefs are involved in the cooking process, they are not the containers or tools used for cooking.

Therefore, the answer is:
<ans> D </ans>

Option E is incorrect because it does not fit the analogy. A chef is not a container or tool used for cooking, but rather a person who performs the cooking process.</s>",,D
Function,burn,fire,blow,wind,down,"The analogy ""burn : fire :: blow :?"" suggests that ""burn"" and ""blow"" are related in the same way that ""burn"" and ""fire"" are. The relationship between ""burn"" and ""fire"" is that of cause and effect - burning is the action that causes fire.

So, the correct answer is the one that completes the analogy with a cause-and-effect relationship between ""blow"" and the missing term.

Therefore, the answer is:

<ans> D: wind </ans>

Explanation:
The correct answer is ""wind"" because blowing is the action that causes wind. Just like burning causes fire, blowing causes wind.

The incorrect answer ""down"" does not complete the analogy correctly because there is no cause-and-effect relationship between ""blow"" and ""down"". ""Down"" is not the cause of ""blow"" or the effect of ""blow"" in this context.</s>",,D
Function,ski,snow,swim,water,swimmer,"In the given analogy, ""ski : snow"" is compared to ""swim : ?"". The first part of the analogy, ""ski : snow"", means that skis are used on snow. Therefore, the second part of the analogy, ""swim : ?"" should mean that swimming is related to something in the same way that skis are related to snow. The answer is:

Explanation: Swimming is an activity that is typically done in water, just as skiing is an activity that is typically done on snow.</s>",,D
Function,tell,story,fight,battle,soldier,"In the given analogy, ""tell : story"" is a relationship of communication or conveying information. Similarly, ""fight"" can also be related to conveying or expressing something, but it is more about conflict or opposition.

Function,run,horse,pull,tractor,muscle,"In the given analogy, ""run"" is related to ""horse"" in the same way that ""pull"" is related to ""?"". The analogy suggests that a horse runs, and the unknown element ""?"" is something that pulls.

Let's consider the options:

D. tractor
E. muscle

A tractor is a heavy vehicle used for agricultural tasks, primarily for pulling heavy loads. So, when we say ""pull"" in the analogy, the correct answer is ""tractor"" because a tractor is an object that pulls.

Function,write,poem,carve,statue,knife,"The analogy ""write : poem :: carve :?"" suggests that writing is to a poem as carving is to something. In this context, the missing part should be an object that is created through the process of carving, just as a poem is created through the process of writing.

Therefore, the answer is:

<ans> D: statue </ans>

Explanation: A poem is a written work, and a statue is a carved work of art. Both are creative expressions that result from a particular process.</s>",,D
Function,ride,bicycle,drink,cup,water,"In the given analogy, ""ride"" is an action performed on a ""bicycle,"" and ""drink"" is an action. The missing part of the analogy should be something that can be consumed during the action of drinking. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> D: cup </ans>

Explanation: The analogy compares the action of riding a bicycle to the action of drinking. The missing part of the analogy should be an object related to the action of drinking. A cup is an object used to contain and consume a liquid while drinking. Therefore, the answer is D: cup.

Alternative answer (incorrect):
<ans> E: water </ans>

Explanation: While water is a common substance consumed during the action of drinking, it is not the correct answer for the given analogy. The analogy requires an object related to the action of drinking, not the substance being consumed. Therefore, E: water is an incorrect answer.</s>",<ans> D </ans></s>,D
Function,throw,ball,jump,parachute,walk,"The analogy ""throw : ball :: jump : ?"" suggests that throwing a ball and jumping are related in some way. The answer should be an action that is related to jumping in the same way that ball is related to throwing.

Let's consider the options:

D. parachute
E. walk

The correct answer is E. walk. The reason is that throwing a ball and jumping are both actions that involve the use of the body. Throwing a ball is an action that propels an object through the air, while jumping is an action that propels the body upward. In the same way, walking is an action that propels the body forward.

The correct answer is:

<ans> E: salmon </ans> or any other specific type of fish would also work.

Explanation:
The analogy is comparing the relationship between a specific type of insect (bee) and the entire insect class, to the relationship between a specific type of fish (salmon or any other) and the entire fish class. So, the answer should be another specific type of fish.</s>","<ans> E </ans>

D: pigeon
E: nest

Since we're looking for a part-to-whole relationship, the answer should be a specific type of bird. Therefore, the correct answer is:
