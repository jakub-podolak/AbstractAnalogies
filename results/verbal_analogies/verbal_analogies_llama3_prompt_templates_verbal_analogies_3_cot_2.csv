Synonym,easy,simple,sad,unhappy,happy,"I'm ready to help. Let's break down the analogy:

""easy : simple :: sad :?""

The analogy is comparing words that are related to each other. ""easy"" and ""simple"" are both adjectives that describe something that is not difficult or complicated. Similarly, ""sad"" is an emotion, and we need to find an emotion that is related to it.

In this case, ""unhappy"" is an emotion that is related to ""sad"", as both describe a negative emotional state. Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,hurry,rush,harm,injure,help,"I'm ready to help. Let's break down the analogy:

hurry : rush :: harm :?

The analogy is saying that ""hurry"" and ""rush"" are related in some way, and we need to find a similar relationship between ""harm"" and the unknown word.

The relationship between ""hurry"" and ""rush"" is that they are both verbs that mean to move quickly. So, we're looking for a verb that means to cause harm.

In this case, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The verb ""injure"" means to cause harm or damage to someone or something.",,D
Synonym,rob,steal,cry,weep,laugh,"I'm ready to help. Let's break down the analogy:

""rob : steal :: cry :?""

The analogy is saying that ""rob"" is related to ""steal"" in the same way that ""cry"" is related to the unknown word.

The relationship between ""rob"" and ""steal"" is that ""steal"" is a verb that means to take something that doesn't belong to you, often in a sneaky or illegal way. This is a type of action that is often associated with ""rob"".

Similarly, the relationship between ""cry"" and the unknown word is that the unknown word is a verb that is related to expressing sadness or distress. This is a type of action that is often associated with ""cry"".

With this in mind, the correct completion of the analogy is:

<ans> D </ans>

The word ""weep"" is a verb that means to cry or shed tears, often in a way that is associated with sadness or distress. This fits with the relationship between ""cry"" and the unknown word in the analogy.",,D
Synonym,polite,courteous,angry,furious,happy,"I'm ready to help. Let's break down the analogy:

""polite : courteous :: angry :?""

The analogy is comparing two pairs of words. The first pair is ""polite"" and ""courteous"", which are both adjectives that describe a person's behavior or manner. They are synonyms, but ""courteous"" is a more formal or old-fashioned way of saying ""polite"".

The second pair is ""angry"" and the unknown word. We need to find a word that is similar to ""angry"" in some way.

The correct completion should maintain the same relationship between the words as the original pair. In this case, ""courteous"" is a more intense or formal version of ""polite"", so we need a word that is a more intense or formal version of ""angry"".

""Furious"" is a more intense version of ""angry"", so it fits the analogy.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,beginner,novice,doctor,physician,heal,"I'm ready to help. Let's break down the analogy:

""beginner : novice :: doctor :?""

The analogy is comparing two pairs of words. The relationship between ""beginner"" and ""novice"" is that they are both early stages of a field or activity. A beginner is someone who is just starting out, and a novice is also someone who is inexperienced but has some knowledge.

The relationship between ""doctor"" and the unknown word is similar. A doctor is a professional in the medical field, and the unknown word should also be a professional in the medical field.

Based on this analysis, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>

The word ""physician"" is a professional in the medical field, just like a doctor.",,D
Synonym,baby,infant,woman,lady,girl,"I'm ready to help. Let's break down the analogy:

""baby : infant :: woman :?""

The analogy is comparing two pairs of words. The first pair is ""baby"" and ""infant"", which are both stages of human development. The second pair is ""woman"" and the unknown word.

To complete the analogy, we need to find a word that is a stage of human development for a woman, just like ""infant"" is a stage of human development for a ""baby"".

The options are:

D: lady
E: girl

A ""lady"" is an adult human being, but it's not a stage of human development. On the other hand, a ""girl"" is a stage of human development for a woman, just like ""infant"" is a stage of human development for a ""baby"".

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> E </ans>",,E
Synonym,brook,stream,courage,bravery,cowardice,"I'm ready to help. Let's break down the analogy:

brook : stream :: courage :?

The analogy is comparing two pairs of words. The first pair is ""brook"" and ""stream"", which are both types of small bodies of water. The second pair is ""courage"" and?, which are both abstract concepts.

The relationship between ""brook"" and ""stream"" is that a stream is a smaller or more specific type of brook. Therefore, we can infer that the relationship between ""courage"" and? is that? is a smaller or more specific type of courage.

The correct answer is therefore the one that fits this description. Bravery is a smaller or more specific type of courage, so:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,huge,enormous,wealthy,rich,poor,"I'm ready to help. Let's break down the analogy:

huge : enormous :: wealthy :?

The analogy is comparing two pairs of words. The relationship between ""huge"" and ""enormous"" is that both words describe something as very large. Similarly, the relationship between ""wealthy"" and the unknown word should be that both words describe someone as having a lot of money.

Synonym,cheerful,happy,awful,horrible,wonderful,"I'm ready to help. Let's analyze the analogy:

cheerful : happy :: awful :?

The analogy is saying that ""cheerful"" and ""happy"" are related in some way, and ""awful"" and? are related in the same way.

The relationship between ""cheerful"" and ""happy"" is that they are both positive emotions. ""Cheerful"" is a more specific word, but it conveys a sense of happiness.

If we apply the same relationship to ""awful"", we can think of a word that is also a negative emotion. ""Horrible"" is a good fit, as it is a strong negative emotion.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,remain,stay,begin,start,continue,"I'm ready to help. Let's break down the analogy:

""remain : stay :: begin :?""

The analogy is saying that ""remain"" is related to ""stay"" in some way, and we need to find a similar relationship between ""begin"" and the unknown.

The relationship between ""remain"" and ""stay"" is that they are both forms of continuing to be in a particular state or location. ""To remain"" means to stay or continue to be in a place or situation, and ""to stay"" also means to continue to be in a place or situation.

Using this logic, we can apply the same relationship to ""begin"" and the unknown. ""To begin"" means to start or initiate something, so the corresponding action to ""begin"" would be to start or initiate something as well.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,unusual,strange,famous,renowned,unknown,"I'm ready to help. Let's break down the analogy:

""unusual : strange :: famous :?""

The analogy is comparing two pairs of words. The relationship between ""unusual"" and ""strange"" is that they are both adjectives that describe something as being unusual or unexpected. So, the relationship is one of synonymy.

If we apply this relationship to the second pair, we're looking for an adjective that describes something as being famous or well-known. A word that fits this description is ""renowned"".

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,sick,ill,little,small,big,"I'm ready to help. Let's break down the analogy:

The analogy is saying that ""sick"" and ""ill"" are related in some way, and we need to find a similar relationship between ""little"" and the unknown word.

The relationship between ""sick"" and ""ill"" is that they are both words that describe a state of being unwell. ""Sick"" is a more informal or colloquial way of saying ""ill"".

So, we need to find a word that is similar to ""small"" in relation to ""little"". ""Small"" is a more formal or precise way of saying ""little"".

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,legal,lawful,usual,normal,strange,"I'm ready to help. Let's break down the analogy:

""legal : lawful :: usual :?""

The analogy is comparing words that are related to each other. ""Legal"" and ""lawful"" are synonyms, both meaning conforming to the law.

So, we need to find a word that is similar to ""usual"" in meaning. ""Usual"" means typical or customary.

A word that is similar in meaning to ""usual"" is ""normal"". It's a word that describes something that is typical or expected.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D

""collect : gather :: leave :?""

The analogy is saying that ""collect"" and ""gather"" are related in some way, and we need to find a similar relationship between ""leave"" and the unknown word.

""Collect"" and ""gather"" both mean to bring things together or accumulate them. They have a similar meaning.

So, we're looking for a word that is similar in meaning to ""leave"" in the same way that ""gather"" is similar in meaning to ""collect"".

""Leave"" means to go away or depart from a place or situation. A word that is similar in meaning to ""leave"" is ""abandon"", which also means to give up or desert something.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,clean,neat,fortunate,lucky,miserable,"I'm ready to help. Let's break down the analogy:

To complete the analogy, we need to find a word that is similar in meaning to ""fortunate"". A word that comes to mind is ""lucky"", which is also a positive adjective that describes a state of good fortune.

So, the correct completion is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,immense,colossal,precise,exact,approximate,"I'm ready to help.

Let's analyze the analogy:

immense : colossal :: precise :?

The analogy is comparing two pairs of words. The first pair is ""immense"" and ""colossal"", which are both large or enormous words. The second pair is ""precise"" and?, which should also be a pair of words that are related in some way.

The relationship between ""immense"" and ""colossal"" is that they are both very large or enormous. Therefore, the relationship between ""precise"" and? should be similar.

""Exact"" is a word that is also very precise or accurate, just like ""colossal"" is very large. On the other hand, ""approximate"" is a word that is not very precise or accurate, which is the opposite of what we're looking for.

So, the correct completion of the analogy is:

<ans> D </ans>",,D
Synonym,stone,rock,garbage,trash,bag,"I'm ready to help. Let's break down the analogy:

The relationship between ""help"" and ""aid"" is that ""aid"" is a type of ""help"". So, we're looking for a word that has a similar relationship with ""raise"".

The options are:

D: lift
E: lower

Hmm... ""raise"" is a verb that means to increase or elevate something. ""Lift"" is also a verb that means to raise or elevate something, so it seems like a good fit.

Therefore, I'm going to choose:

<ans> D </ans>",,D

With this in mind, let's look at the options:

D: forbid
E: permit

The relationship between ""allow"" and the unknown is similar to the relationship between ""give"" and ""take"". ""Allow"" means to permit or grant permission for something to happen, while ""forbid"" means to prohibit or prevent something from happening.
