Synonym,easy,simple,sad,unhappy,happy,"Analogy:
easy : simple :: sad : ?

Explanation:
The analogy ""easy : simple"" suggests that when something is easy, it requires less effort or complexity. The term ""simple"" in this context refers to something that is not complex or uncomplicated.

Completion D: sad : unhappy
Explanation:
The term ""unhappy"" can be considered as a state of sadness or a feeling that is opposite to happiness. In the analogy, ""sad"" is related to ""unhappy"" in the same way that ""easy"" is related to ""simple"". When something is sad, it is a state of being unhappy or feeling a lack of happiness.

Completion E: sad : happy
Explanation:
The term ""happy"" is the opposite of ""sad"". In the analogy, ""sad"" is related to ""happy"" in the same way that ""easy"" is related to ""simple"". However, this completion does not correctly complete the analogy as the relationship between ""sad"" and ""happy"" is not the same as the relationship between ""easy"" and ""simple"".

Comparison:
The relationship between ""easy"" and ""simple"" is that of less complexity or effort required. The relationship between ""sad"" and ""unhappy"" is that of a feeling state that is opposite to each other. While both pairs have an opposing relationship, the relationship between ""sad"" and ""happy"" is not the same as the relationship between ""easy"" and ""simple"".

Explanation:

A) rob and steal are both actions related to taking something from someone without permission.
B) cry and ? are both emotional expressions.

Completion D: weep

Explanation:

D relates to the analogy as weeping is an emotional expression similar to crying. When someone robs, they take something, and when someone cries, they express an emotion. Weeping is a type of crying, so it completes the analogy by maintaining the relationship between the actions and the emotional expressions.

Completion E: laugh

Explanation:

E does not relate to the analogy as laughing is not an emotional expression similar to crying. While rob and steal are actions related to taking something, cry and laugh are emotional expressions with different meanings.

Polite and courteous are both related to behavior and manners. Polite behavior is characterized by being considerate and respectful towards others. Courteous behavior is similar, but it specifically refers to being polite and kind in social situations.

Angry and furious are both related to emotions. Anger is a feeling of frustration, annoyance, or hostility. Fury is a more intense and extreme form of anger, characterized by intense emotion and a strong desire for revenge or retaliation.

Comparing the relationships:

Angry and furious are related in that they both refer to emotions. Fury is a more intense and extreme form of anger.

Based on the comparisons, the correct completion is:

Explanation:

The analogy is stating that polite is to courteous as angry is to furious. Polite and courteous are related in that they both refer to behavior and manners, with courteous being a more specific form of polite behavior. Angry and furious are related in that they both refer to emotions, with furious being a more intense and extreme form of anger. Therefore, the correct completion is ""furious"" to complete the analogy.</s>",,D
Synonym,beginner,novice,doctor,physician,heal,"Analogy:

A physician is a doctor who practices medicine. The term ""doctor"" is often used interchangeably with ""physician,"" but they are not exactly the same. A physician is a specific type of doctor who provides primary care and diagnoses and treats illnesses.

Completion E: heal

Explanation:

Healing refers to the process of restoring health or wholeness to someone or something. Doctors are professionals who heal people, but ""heal"" is not a professional title. It is a verb that describes the action of restoring health.

Comparison:

Completion D, ""physician,"" is a specific type of doctor who heals people. Completion E, ""heal,"" is the action of restoring health. The analogy compares the role of a beginner in learning to the role of a novice in gaining experience, and the role of a doctor in healing to the role of a healer in restoring health. However, the analogy is more closely aligned with completion D, as it compares the roles of professionals in their respective fields.

Completion D: bravery

Bravery is a quality of mind or disposition that enables a person to face and endure danger or adversity, just as a brook is a small stream that is a part of a larger body of flowing water, a stream.

Completion E: cowardice

Cowardice is the opposite of courage, it is the inability to face and endure danger or adversity. However, the analogy does not suggest that courage is the opposite of a stream or a brook, but rather that courage is to people what a brook is to a stream.

Comparisons:

Completion D correctly completes the analogy as it shows that courage is to people what a brook is to a stream, a small part that is a part of a larger entity.

Completion E does not correctly complete the analogy as it suggests that courage is the opposite of a stream or a brook, which is not the case.

E does not relate to the analogy as ""poor"" is the opposite of ""wealthy"" and ""huge"" and ""enormous"" are not opposites.

Comparison:

The relationship between ""huge"" and ""enormous"" is one of degree, with ""enormous"" being a larger degree of size than ""huge"". The relationship between ""wealthy"" and ""D"" is also one of degree, with ""D"" being another term for having a large amount of money or resources, similar to ""wealthy"".

Completion D: horrible

Explanation for D:
The word ""horrible"" is also used to describe something that is extremely unpleasant or distressing, similar to the meaning of ""awful."" Therefore, the analogy ""cheerful : happy :: awful : horrible"" holds true.

Completion E: wonderful

Explanation for E:
The word ""wonderful"" is used to describe something that is amazing, impressive, or delightful. While it is an opposite of ""awful,"" it does not fit the analogy as well as ""horrible"" does. The analogy ""cheerful : happy :: awful : wonderful"" does not hold true because ""wonderful"" is not an opposite of ""cheerful"" in the same way that ""horrible"" is an opposite of ""happy.""

Comparisons:

Completion D correctly completes the analogy by providing a term that is an opposite of ""happy"" in the same way that ""awful"" is an opposite of ""cheerful.""

Explanation:

A. ""Remain"" means to continue in the same state or position. ""Stay"" also means to continue in the same place or state.
B. ""Begin"" means to start or initiate something.

Completion D:
""Begin"" and ""start"" are synonyms, both meaning to initiate or commence something. Therefore, completion D, ""start,"" correctly completes the analogy.

Completion E:
""Continue"" means to carry on with an activity or process that has already begun. While ""remain"" and ""stay"" can imply a continuation of the current state, they also have meanings beyond just continuation.

Comparison:
The analogy compares the relationship between ""remain"" and ""stay"" to the relationship between ""begin"" and another term. Completion D correctly completes the analogy by using a term that is synonymous with ""begin"" and shares the same relationship with ""remain"" and ""stay."" Completion E, while related, does not perfectly complete the analogy as ""continue"" is not a synonym for ""begin.""

2. Completion E: Strange means unusual or abnormal. However, the analogy does not suggest that usual is strange, but rather that usual is the opposite of legal when lawful is the opposite of illegal.

Comparison:

The relationships presented in completions D and E are not the same as the analogy. Completion D correctly completes the analogy by maintaining the relationship between legal and lawful, and usual and normal. Completion E does not correctly complete the analogy as it suggests a relationship between usual and strange, which is not present in the analogy.

Explanation:
In this analogy, ""collect"" and ""gather"" are related as actions that bring or accumulate items together. ""Leave,"" on the other hand, is related to the idea of departing or being absent.

Completion D: abandon

Explanation:
""Abandon"" means to give up or forsake something. In the context of the analogy, it could be seen as the opposite of ""collect"" or ""gather,"" which are actions that bring items together.

Completion E: stay

Explanation:
""Stay"" means to remain in a place or continue an action. While it is related to the idea of being present, it does not have the same relationship to the idea of leaving as ""abandon"" does to the idea of collecting.

Comparison:
The relationship between ""collect"" and ""gather"" is one of synonymy or near-synonymy. Both words refer to the action of bringing items together. The relationship between ""leave"" and ""abandon"" is one of antonymy, or opposite meanings. ""Leave"" refers to the action of departing or being absent, while ""abandon"" refers to the action of giving up or forsaking something.

Completion D: exact

Explanation:

Completion D, ""exact,"" is a term that describes something that is precise and accurate. It fits well with the analogy because ""precise"" is also a term that describes something that is exact and accurate. The relationship between ""immense"" and ""colossal"" is one of size and extent, while the relationship between ""precise"" and ""exact"" is one of accuracy and detail.

Completion E: approximate

Explanation:

Completion E, ""approximate,"" is a term that describes something that is not exact or not an exact measurement. It does not fit well with the analogy because ""precise"" is a term that describes something that is exact and accurate. The relationship between ""immense"" and ""colossal"" is one of size and extent, while the relationship between ""precise"" and ""approximate"" is one of accuracy and imprecision.

Comparisons:

Completion D, ""exact,"" completes the analogy by maintaining the relationship of accuracy and detail between ""precise"" and the missing term.

B. ""Garbage is to?"" is asking for a term that is related to garbage in the same way that rock is related to stone.

Relationship between C and A:
C (succeed) is to A (alive) as a positive outcome or achievement is to the existence or presence of something.

Relationship between D and B:
D (fail) is to B (dead) as a lack of achievement or success is to the absence of life.

Relationship between E and C:
E (conquer) is to C (succeed) as gaining control or mastery over something is to achieving a positive outcome or success.

Comparison:
The relationship between A and B (alive and dead) is about the presence and absence of life. The relationship between C and D (succeed and fail) is about achieving a positive outcome or success and its opposite. The relationship between C and E (succeed and conquer) is about gaining control or mastery over something as a means to achieving a positive outcome or success.

The relationship between C and D (succeed and fail) is more directly related to the analogy as it deals with the presence and absence of a positive outcome or success, which is a key aspect of the analogy.

Therefore, the answer is:

Completion D: wither

Explanation:

""Wither"" refers to the process of decay or dying. In the context of the analogy, ""wither"" could be seen as the opposite of ""grow."" Just as ""quick"" is the opposite of ""slow,"" ""grow"" is the opposite of ""wither.""

Completion E: plant

Explanation:

""Plant"" is not the opposite of ""grow."" Instead, a plant is something that grows. The relationship between ""grow"" and ""plant"" is not the same as the relationship between ""quick"" and ""slow.""

The relationship between ""quick"" and ""slow"" is one of opposites. The relationship between ""grow"" and ""wither"" is also one of opposites. However, the relationship between ""grow"" and ""plant"" is not one of opposites.

Answer:

<ans> D </ans>

Explanation:

The correct completion is ""wither."" The analogy suggests that the relationship between ""quick"" and ""slow"" is the same as the relationship between ""grow"" and the missing term. Since ""quick"" and ""slow"" are opposites, the missing term must also be an opposite of ""grow,"" making ""wither"" the correct answer.</s>",,D
Opposite,antonym,synonym,selfish,generous,egocentric,"Analogy:
antonym : synonym :: selfish : ?

Explanation:

A: antonym
B: synonym

In this analogy, antonyms are related as opposites, while synonyms are related as words with similar meanings.

Completion D: generous

Explanation:

Selfish and generous are opposites in the sense that being selfish means focusing primarily on one's own interests, while being generous means being willing to give or share with others. Therefore, just as antonyms are opposites, selfish and generous are opposites as well.

Completion E: egocentric

Explanation:

Egocentric and selfless are opposites in the sense that being egocentric means being excessively self-centered, while being selfless means being concerned for the welfare of others. However, the relationship between selfish and egocentric is not exactly the same as that between antonyms. While selfish and generous are opposites in the sense that they represent opposite ways of thinking about one's own interests, selfish and egocentric are related in that both involve a focus on one's own interests, but selfish may not necessarily imply an excessive focus, while egocentric does.

Comparisons:

Completion D correctly completes the analogy because it represents the opposite of selfish in the same way that antonyms represent opposites.

Completion E does not correctly complete the analogy because it does not represent the opposite of selfish in the same way that antonyms represent opposites.

Opposite,start,stop,trivial,important,famous,"Analogy:
start : stop :: trivial : ?

Explanation:
The analogy ""start : stop :: trivial : ?"" is comparing two pairs of concepts. The first pair, ""start"" and ""stop,"" are opposites in the sense that ""start"" initiates an action, while ""stop"" ends it. The second pair, ""trivial"" and ""?"" are related in some way, but the relationship is not clear without additional context.

Completion D: important

Explanation:
Completion D, ""important,"" suggests that ""trivial"" is the opposite of important. In this context, ""trivial"" would refer to concepts or ideas that are unimportant or insignificant. This interpretation fits with the first pair of concepts in the analogy, as ""start"" and ""stop"" are also opposites.

Completion E: famous

Explanation:
Completion E, ""famous,"" does not fit as well with the analogy. While ""trivial"" and ""important"" are opposites, ""trivial"" and ""famous"" are not directly related. ""Famous"" refers to concepts or ideas that are well-known or recognized, while ""trivial"" refers to concepts or ideas that are unimportant or insignificant.

Comparison:
The relationship between ""start"" and ""stop"" is one of opposition, while the relationship between ""trivial"" and ""important"" is also one of opposition. Completion D correctly completes the analogy by maintaining this relationship of opposition. Completion E does not fit as well, as ""trivial"" and ""famous"" are not directly related in the same way that ""start"" and ""stop"" are.

Opposite,laugh,cry,cheap,expensive,inexpensive,"Analogy:
laugh : cry :: cheap : ?

Explanation:

A. In this analogy, ""laugh"" and ""cry"" are emotions that are related to each other. ""Laugh"" is considered the opposite emotion of ""cry,"" with ""laugh"" being a positive, happy emotion and ""cry"" being a negative, sad emotion.

B. ""Cheap"" and ""?"" are economic terms. ""Cheap"" refers to an item or service that is priced lower than average or expected.

C. Completion D: ""expensive""

D. Completion D relates to the analogy by suggesting that just as ""cry"" is the opposite emotion of ""laugh,"" ""expensive"" is the opposite economic term of ""cheap.""

E. Completion E: ""inexpensive""

E. Completion E also relates to the analogy by suggesting that ""inexpensive"" is the opposite economic term of ""cheap.""

Comparison:

The relationships presented in completions D and E are similar in that they both suggest opposites of ""cheap."" However, the analogy itself suggests opposites of emotions, not economic terms. Therefore, the completion that correctly completes the analogy should suggest an opposite emotion, not an opposite economic term.

Answer:

<ans> D </ans> is incorrect because it suggests an opposite economic term, not an opposite emotion.

<ans> E </ans> is also incorrect because it suggests an opposite economic term, not an opposite emotion.

The correct completion would suggest an opposite emotion to ""laugh."" Since ""laugh"" is a positive, happy emotion, the opposite emotion would be a negative, sad emotion.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

Opposite,accept,reject,dark,bright,dim,"Analogy: accept : reject :: dark : ?

Explanation:
The analogy ""accept : reject :: dark : ?"" suggests that there is a relationship between the pairs ""accept/reject"" and ""dark/?"". The relationship between ""accept"" and ""reject"" is one of opposites - accept is the positive action, while reject is the negative. The relationship between ""dark"" and ""?"" is not clear without additional context.

Completion D: bright

Explanation:
Completion D suggests that ""dark"" is to ""?"" as ""accept"" is to ""bright"". This means that ""?"" is being suggested as the opposite of bright, which is dim. However, this is not the intended relationship in the analogy.

Completion E: dim

Explanation:
Completion E suggests that ""dark"" is to ""?"" as ""accept"" is to ""dim"". This means that ""?"" is being suggested as the opposite of accept, which is reject. This is the intended relationship in the analogy.

Comparison:
In the intended relationship, ""accept"" and ""dark"" are related as opposites, with ""accept"" being the positive action and ""dark"" being the negative state. Similarly, ""reject"" and ""dim"" are also related as opposites, with ""reject"" being the negative action and ""dim"" being the negative state.

Relationship between A and B: Abundant and scarce are opposites. Abundant means having more than enough, while scarce means having a limited supply.

Relationship between A and C: Agree and abundant share a similarity in that they both represent a positive or favorable situation.

Relationship between B and C: Scarce and disagree share a similarity in that they both represent a negative or unfavorable situation.

Relationship between C and D: Agree and disagree are opposites. Agree means having a shared opinion or consensus, while disagree means having differing opinions.

Relationship between C and E: Agree and concur also share a similarity in that they both represent a positive or favorable situation.

Comparison:

The analogy ""abundant : scarce :: agree : ?"" requires a negative opposite for agree. Completion D, disagree, correctly completes the analogy as it represents the negative opposite of agree. Completion E, concur, while related to agree, does not represent the negative opposite.

Opposite,hero,coward,strong,weak,muscular,"Analogy:
hero : coward :: strong : ?

Explanation:

A. In this analogy, ""hero"" is compared to ""coward"" using the relationship ""is to"" and the comparative relationship ""::"" is used to connect ""strong"" to ""?"". The relationship between ""hero"" and ""coward"" is one of opposition, where the hero is the opposite of a coward. The hero is brave, courageous, and fearless, while a coward is the opposite, being afraid and lacking courage.

B. Completion D, ""weak"", relates to the analogy by completing the comparative relationship between ""strong"" and ""?"". In this context, ""weak"" is the opposite of ""strong"", making it a valid completion for the analogy.

C. Completion E, ""muscular"", does not correctly complete the analogy. While ""muscular"" is related to ""strong"" in the sense that being muscular is a sign of strength, it does not complete the analogy as intended. The analogy requires a completion that is the opposite of ""strong"", making ""weak"" the correct answer.

Completion E: serene

Explanation for E:
A teacher is calm and in control in the classroom, while a student can be serene or focused. The teacher's calm demeanor helps create a peaceful learning environment, while a serene student is fully engaged and attentive.

Comparison:
In the case of completion D, the teacher is calm while the student is disruptive and stormy. In the case of completion E, the teacher is calm while the student is focused and serene.

The correct completion is D: stormy. The analogy is about the contrast between the teacher's calm demeanor and the student's behavior. A stormy student is disruptive and creates chaos, while a calm teacher helps maintain order and focus.

Opposite,give,take,allow,forbid,permit,"Analogy: give : take :: allow : ?

Explanation:

Giving and taking are opposite actions. When you give something, you transfer ownership or control to the recipient. When you take something, you acquire ownership or control for yourself.

Allowing and forbidding are also opposite actions. When you allow something, you give permission or approval for it to happen. When you forbid something, you deny permission or disapprove of it.

Completion D: forbid

Explanation:

The completion ""forbid"" is related to the analogy because giving is the opposite of taking, and allowing is the opposite of forbidding. Just as giving transfers control or ownership, allowing gives permission or approval. Forbidding, on the other hand, denies permission or disapproves, which is the opposite of allowing.

Completion E: permit

Explanation:

The completion ""permit"" is also related to the analogy because giving is the opposite of taking, and allowing is the opposite of forbidding. Permitting is another way of saying ""giving permission"" or ""granting approval,"" which is the opposite of forbidding.

Comparison:

Both completions D and E correctly complete the analogy by providing opposite actions to allowing. However, the analogy specifically asks for the opposite of ""forbid,"" which is ""permit."" Therefore, the correct completion is E: permit.

A is the opposite of B, meaning A is the state that is free of B. In this case, A is clean and B is dirty.

C: awake
D: asleep

C is also the opposite of D, meaning C is the state that is not D. In this context, C is awake and D is asleep.

Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E:

Asleep is a state of rest and lack of consciousness, similar to how dirty is a state or condition that is not clean.

However, alert is a state of heightened awareness and focus, which is not the opposite of awake in the same way dirty is the opposite of clean.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

Explanation:

A: remember is the opposite of forgetting, so it retains information.
B: forget is the process of losing information.

Completion D: decrease
Explanation:
C: increase is the opposite of decrease, so it adds or enhances something.

In this analogy, completion D does not correctly complete the analogy because remember and forget are related to information retention and loss, while increase and decrease are related to addition and subtraction, respectively.

Completion E: lengthen
Explanation:
C: increase can also mean to lengthen or extend something.

However, completion E does not correctly complete the analogy because remember and forget are not directly related to length or extension.

Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy:

Completion D: remember : forget :: decrease : ?
This analogy does not make sense because remember and forget are not directly related to decrease.

Completion E: remember : forget :: increase : lengthen

Relationship between A and B:
The relationship between crazy and sane is one of opposites. Crazy is a state of mind that is marked by extreme behavior, while sane is a state of sound and rational mind.

Relationship between C and D:
The relationship between bent and straight is also one of opposites. Bent is a state of being curved or not in a straight line, while straight is a state of being in a straight line or not curved.

Comparison:
The relationship between crazy and sane is similar to the relationship between bent and straight in that they are opposites. However, the analogy specifically uses the words ""bent"" and ""straight"" in the context of lines, while ""crazy"" and ""sane"" are used in the context of states of mind.

Therefore, the correct completion is:

<ans> D: straight </ans>

Completion D: clothes

Explanation:

D relates to the analogy as the completion of the second part of the analogy. Just as the ear is related to hearing, clothes are related to wearing. Wearing clothes covers and protects our bodies, similar to how the ear covers and protects our auditory organs.

Completion E: woman

Explanation:

E does not relate to the analogy as the completion of the second part of the analogy. The analogy is about hearing and wearing, not about ears and women. While women can wear clothes, the analogy is not about women but about the relationship between hearing and wearing, and ears and clothes.

B. Completion D, ""wood,"" relates to the analogy as something that can be burned. The analogy suggests that ""burn"" is related to something that can be burned, making completion D a valid completion.

C. Completion E, ""fire,"" also relates to the analogy as something that can be produced by burning and can burn things. However, the analogy suggests that ""burn"" is an action that can be performed with something, and ""fire"" is the result of that action, making it less directly related to the analogy.

D. Comparing the relationships presented in completions D and E with the analogy, we can see that completion D directly completes the analogy by providing something that can be burned, completing the analogy's second part.

Explanation:

A door is an object that can be opened to gain access to a room or a space. In the same way, touching is an action that can be performed on an object or a surface to gain a sense of its texture, temperature, or other physical properties.

Completion D:
The completion ""hands"" relates to the analogy because hands are the primary tools we use to open doors and to touch objects. When we open a door, we usually use our hands to turn the doorknob or push or pull the door. Similarly, when we touch an object, we use our hands to feel its texture, shape, or temperature.

Completion E:
The completion ""doctor"" does not relate to the analogy in a meaningful way. While a doctor may touch a patient to diagnose an injury or illness, the action of touching is not the primary function of a doctor. The analogy is about the relationship between opening a door and touching an object, not between opening a door and being a doctor.

Comparison:
The relationship between opening a door and touching an object is one of action and sensation. Opening a door is an action that allows us to gain access to a space or room, while touching an object is an action that allows us to gain a sense of its properties.

C. ""Blow"" means to forcefully expel air from the lungs or to move something by applying force with the breath or a tool.

Completion D:
""Wind"" is a flow of air that can be blown by the wind. It is a force that can cause damage or destruction when strong enough, just like fire. Therefore, ""wind"" can complete the analogy as the missing term.

Completion E:
""Down"" is not related to the analogy as it does not complete the relationship between ""burn"" and ""fire"" or ""blow"" and the missing term.

Comparison:
The relationship between ""burn"" and ""fire"" is that of cause and effect, where ""burn"" is the action and ""fire"" is the substance that causes the action.

In this analogy, ""run"" is an action that a horse performs. ""Horse"" is the agent that performs the action. In the same way, ""pull"" is an action that something does, and we are looking for the agent that performs this action.

Completion D: tractor

Explanation:

A tractor is a machine that performs the action of pulling. It is used to pull heavy loads or till the soil. In the analogy, ""tractor"" would complete the analogy as the agent that performs the action of pulling.

Completion E: muscle

Explanation:

Muscles are not agents that perform the action of pulling. They are the organs that contract to produce force and motion. In the analogy, ""muscle"" would not correctly complete the analogy as the agent that performs the action of pulling.

Comparison:

Completion D, ""tractor,"" correctly completes the analogy as the agent that performs the action of pulling. Completion E, ""muscle,"" does not correctly complete the analogy as it is not the agent that performs the action of pulling.

Function,write,poem,carve,statue,knife,"Analogy:
write : poem :: carve : ?

Explanation:

Write and poem are connected in the sense that writing is the process of creating a poem. Poem is the result or product of the writing process.

Carve and statue are connected in the same way. Carving is the process of creating a statue, and statue is the result or product of the carving process.

Comparison:

In the given analogy, write is to poem as carve is to (D) or (E).

Completion D: statue
Explanation:
The completion ""statue"" correctly completes the analogy because, just as a poem is the result or product of the writing process, a statue is the result or product of the carving process.

Explanation:

A. In the given analogy, ""ride"" is an action performed on a ""bicycle."" ""Bicycle"" is the object on which the action is performed.
B. ""Drink"" is an action, and in the context of the analogy, it requires something to be completed.

Completion D: cup

Explanation:

A. ""Cup"" is an object that is used to contain and consume a liquid while ""drinking.""
B. In the analogy, ""cup"" completes the relationship by being the object that is consumed while ""drinking,"" similar to how a ""bicycle"" is the object on which ""ride"" is performed.

Completion E: water

Explanation:

A. ""Water"" is a liquid that is consumed during the action of ""drinking.""
B. However, ""water"" is not completing the relationship in the analogy as it is not an object that is consumed during the action of ""drink."" Instead, it is a substance that is being consumed.

Comparison:

A. Completion D correctly completes the analogy by providing an object that is consumed during the action of ""drink,"" similar to how a ""bicycle"" is the object on which ""ride"" is performed.
B. Completion E does not correctly complete the analogy as it is not an object that is consumed during the action of ""drink.""

Function,throw,ball,jump,parachute,walk,"Analogy:
throw : ball :: jump : ?

Explanation:

A. ""throw : ball"" is an action performed with an object. In this case, the action is ""throw"" and the object is ""ball"".
B. ""jump"" is also an action.
C. ""parachute"" is an object that allows for a controlled descent from a height.
D. ""walk"" is an action that involves moving one's body by taking steps.

Relationship between the analogy and completion D:
The relationship between ""throw"" and ""ball"" is that of an action and the object being acted upon. The relationship between ""jump"" and completion D, ""parachute"", is not directly related to the analogy. However, we could say that ""parachute"" is an object that allows for a controlled descent, similar to how a ""ball"" is an object that can be acted upon during the action of ""throwing"". But this is a stretch and not a direct comparison.

Relationship between the analogy and completion E:
The relationship between ""throw"" and ""ball"" is that of an action and the object being acted upon. The relationship between ""jump"" and completion E, ""walk"", is not directly related to the analogy. ""Walk"" is an action that involves moving one's body by taking steps, while ""jump"" is also an action that involves lifting one's body off the ground. However, ""ball"" and ""parachute"" are more directly related to the actions of ""throw"" and ""jump"" respectively, as they are the objects being acted upon.

Comparison:
The relationship between ""throw"" and ""ball"" is that of an action and the object being acted upon. The relationship between ""jump"" and ""parachute"" is that of an action and an object that allows for a controlled descent. The relationship between ""jump"" and ""walk"" is that of two actions.

Based on the comparisons, the correct completion is D: ""parachute"". While ""walk"" is an action that can be compared to ""jump"" in some ways, it is not directly related to the analogy as it does not complete the comparison between ""throw"" and ""jump"". ""Parachute"" is an object that allows for a controlled descent, similar to how a ""ball"" is an object that can be acted upon during the action of ""throwing"".

Function,ride,elevator,sail,boat,wind,"Analogy:
ride : elevator :: sail : ?

Explanation:

A. In the first part of the analogy, ""ride"" refers to moving smoothly and comfortably within a confined space, such as an elevator.
B. In the second part of the analogy, ""sail"" refers to moving smoothly and at the mercy of external forces, such as wind or currents, on a boat.

Completion D: boat

Explanation:

D correctly completes the analogy because a boat is a means of transportation that moves smoothly and at the mercy of external forces, like wind or currents, similar to how a person rides smoothly and at the mercy of the elevator's movement.

Completion E: wind

Explanation:

E does not correctly complete the analogy because wind is not a means of transportation, but rather an external force that affects the transportation method (sailboat).

Comparisons:

Completion D, ""boat,"" is a means of transportation that moves smoothly and at the mercy of external forces, making it a correct completion of the analogy.
Completion E, ""wind,"" is an external force that affects the transportation method, but it is not a means of transportation itself.

Category Members,vegetable,cabbage,insect,beetle,frog,"Analogy:
vegetable : cabbage :: insect : ?

Explanation:
The analogy ""vegetable : cabbage :: insect : ?"" suggests that cabbage is to vegetables as a specific type of insect is to insects. In other words, cabbage is a type of vegetable, and the unknown insect is a type of insect that shares some common characteristic or relationship with insects as cabbage does with vegetables.

Completion D: beetle

Explanation:
A beetle is a type of insect. Beetles have several characteristics that make them a good fit for the analogy. For instance, just as cabbage is a common and well-known vegetable, beetles are a common and well-known type of insect. Additionally, both cabbage and beetles can be found in various environments and play essential roles in their respective ecosystems.

Completion E: frog

Explanation:
A frog is also an insect, but it is not as good a fit for the analogy as a beetle. While both cabbage and frog are members of their respective categories (vegetables and insects), the relationship between cabbage and vegetables is more straightforward and direct than the relationship between a frog and insects. Frogs are not as representative or common as beetles within the insect kingdom.

Comparison:
The relationship between cabbage and vegetables is that of a specific type to a broader category. In the same way, beetles are a specific type of insect, making the relationship between beetles and insects analogous to that of cabbage and vegetables. Frog, on the other hand, is also an insect, but it does not share the same level of representativeness or commonality as beetles within the insect kingdom.

Category Members,insect,bee,fish,halibut,water,"Analogy:
insect : bee :: fish : ?

Explanation:

Bee is a type of insect. In the insect world, bees have a special role as pollinators. They are essential for the production of honey and beeswax, which have various uses for humans.

Fish are aquatic organisms. In the aquatic world, certain fish species, like halibut, play a crucial role as top predators. They maintain the balance of the ecosystem by controlling the population of other fish and keeping the food chain in check.

Completion D: halibut

Explanation:
Halibut is a large, flatfish that plays a significant role in the aquatic food chain as a top predator. This role is analogous to bees in the insect world, as they are essential pollinators.

Completion E: water

Explanation:
Water is an essential element for both insects and fish. Insects need water for various life processes, such as metamorphosis and hydration. Fish live in water and require it for breathing, feeding, and maintaining their body temperature.

Comparison:
The analogy ""insect : bee :: fish : halibut"" suggests that bees are to insects as halibut are to fish. Both bees and halibut have a unique role in their respective ecosystems. Bees are essential pollinators, while halibut are top predators.

The analogy ""insect : bee :: fish : water"" suggests that bees are to insects as water is to fish. However, this analogy does not accurately represent the relationship between bees and insects or fish and water. Bees are a specific type of insect, while water is an essential element for all fish.

Explanation:
The analogy ""bird : wren"" suggests a specific type of bird, the wren. In the same way, the analogy ""insect : ?"" should suggest a specific type of insect.

Completion D: mosquito

Explanation:
Mosquitoes are a specific type of insect. They are small, fly, and feed on the blood of living organisms. Wrens are a specific type of bird. They are small, have a distinctive shape and behavior, and are found in various habitats. The analogy holds because both wrens and mosquitoes are specific types within their respective categories.

Completion E: sting

Explanation:
A sting is not a specific type of insect. It is a defensive mechanism used by certain insects, such as bees and wasps, to protect themselves. While wrens and mosquitoes can be related through their specific types, wrens and stings do not share this relationship.

Comparison:
The relationship between ""bird"" and ""wren"" is that of a general category and a specific type. The relationship between ""insect"" and ""mosquito"" is also that of a general category and a specific type. In contrast, the relationship between ""insect"" and ""sting"" is not that of a general category and a specific type, but rather a general category and a characteristic or behavior.
