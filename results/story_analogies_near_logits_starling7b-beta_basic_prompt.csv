Story A is the most analogous to the source story. In both stories, the main character (William in the source story and Kevin in Story A) is a patient in a mental institution who dislikes cleaning their room and fails the room inspections. They both have a strong interest in food, and a promise of a treat (gingerbread in the source story and a cake in Story A) is used as motivation to clean their rooms. However, in both stories, the characters fail to clean their rooms in time and do not receive the promised treat. Story B, on the other hand, focuses more on Kevin's daydreaming about the cake rather than his failure to clean his room, making it less analogous to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",A,A,False,,

Story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, the manager/director experiences a severe injury while using a new, sharp blade. This incident leads them to consider the safety feature necessary and have it developed immediately, despite initial reservations about its cost or necessity. The main difference between the two stories is the outcome of the injury (neck vs. throat) and the company they work for (razor company vs. Gilette Company). However, the overall structure and key events are similar enough to consider Story B as the more analogous version of the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",B,B,False,,

Story A is analogous to the source story because both involve young men from cold-climate countries (Iceland and Sweden) who move to warmer climates (Florida and Hawaii) and try to get a tan. In both stories, the characters underestimate the dangers of sun exposure and end up with severe sunburns, leading them to decide that the warmer climate is not for them and they return to their home countries.

Story B is the most analogous to the source story. In both stories, two weak nations (Bolon and Salam in the source story, Lincoln and Moreland in Story B) are adjacent to a powerful, aggressive nation (Mayonia in the source story, Chad in Story B). Moreland (or Bolon) tries to make the best of the situation by conquering the weaker neighbor (Salam or Lincoln) but ultimately fails when the powerful neighbor (Mayonia or Chad) invades and takes control of both nations. Additionally, in both stories, the aggressive neighbor installs puppet governments and takes control of the media (newspapers and radio stations) in the conquered nations.<|end_of_turn|>",B,B,False,,

Story A is analogous to the source story because it shares the same basic plot structure and elements. In both stories, a farmer (or grower) has a special fruit-bearing tree/vine that they value and share with others. When the tree/vine begins to wither and stop producing fruit, a prominent figure (judge/mayor) decides to buy the tree/vine, transplant it to their own property, and care for it. As a result, the tree/vine starts producing fruit again and even wins a prize in the source story.

Story B, on the other hand, has a different outcome where the vine dries up after being transplanted, leading to disappointment. This does not follow the same pattern as the source story, where the tree/vine successfully produces fruit again after being transplanted.<|end_of_turn|>",A,A,False,,

Zebediah the cowherd was watching over his herd and he dozed off. When he awoke he discovered that one calf was missing. He could not find it anywhere. Zebediah figured that the thief was still nearby so he started yelling for whoever stole the calf to show his face.
 Suddenly a monstrous tiger came out of the woods and started walking towards him. Zebediah was surprised and very frightened. He wished he had left the tiger alone.
 To escape, he gave the tiger a second calf. While the tiger was occupied, Zebediah took the remainder of the herd to a safer place!

Story A is the most analogous to the source story. In both stories, the protagonist (Frederick in the source story and Zebediah in Story A) is tending their flock when a dangerous predator (a lion in the source story and a tiger in Story A) appears.

They then give the predator a sacrifice (a lamb in the source story and a calf in Story A) to distract it and lead their remaining flock to safety.
