In the source story, William's room is a mess because he spends most of his time daydreaming about food. The nurse promises him gingerbread as an incentive to clean his room, but he doesn't have enough time to do so and fails the inspection.

In story A, Kevin's room is a disaster because he spends all his time daydreaming. The matron promises him a cake as an incentive to clean his room, but he doesn't have enough time to do so and doesn't get the cake.

In story B, Kevin's room is a mess because he despises cleaning. The matron promises him a cake as an incentive to clean his room, but he spends most of his time dreaming about the bakery and deciding what kind of cake to get, and doesn't clean his room.

So, both stories A and B are analogous to the source story in terms of the main character's dislike for cleaning, the promise of a treat as an incentive, and the failure to clean the room and receive the treat. However, the reasons for the failure to clean the room differ slightly between the stories.

Story A is the most analogous to the source story. In both stories, the manager (Mr. Newton in the source story and Mr. Boyce in Story A) experiences a severe injury while using a new, sharp blade. As a result, an inventor/engineer recommends a safety feature to prevent such accidents. The manager then considers the safety feature necessary and has it developed immediately.

Story B is not as analogous because it initially portrays Mr. Boyce as dismissive of the protective part, citing cost as a reason. It is only after his own accident that he changes his mind and has the protective part developed. This aspect of the story does not align with the source story, where Mr. Newton immediately considers the safety feature necessary after the incident.<|end_of_turn|>",A,A,False,,

In story A, John and Christian form a company based on their mutual respect for each other's technical judgment. John learns about Christian's forgetfulness and insists that Christian never handle the company's finances. This situation is similar to the source story, as it involves two individuals with complementary skills deciding to work together, and one person's forgetfulness leading to a decision about financial responsibilities.

In story B, Christian's forgetfulness leads to him putting all their money in the trash, which upsets John and results in him insisting that Christian never deal with the finances.

Provide final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>","Both story A and story B are analogous to the source story in different ways. 

In story A, the emperor's obsession with war and neglect of domestic expenditures (such as maintaining roads) is similar to King Otto's focus on conquest and bridge rebuilding. The accident involving the overpass in story A serves as a wake-up call for Emperor Cornelius, just as the carriage crash does for King Otto. Both rulers learn the importance of balancing military and domestic spending after their accidents.

In story B, the emperor's decision to renovate roads for his armed forces parallels King Otto's bridge rebuilding project. The prime minister's complaint about spending on roads instead of warfare is similar to the chamberlain's concern in the source story. The accident with the overpass in story B also serves as a turning point for Emperor Cornelius, leading him to reconsider his priorities.

- In story A, the burglar steals the nests while Lyle is away, and the poultry attack him when they return and find their nests missing. In the source story and story B, the burglar steals the eggs or nests while the protagonist is distracted by the aggressive chickens or poultry.
- In story B, the protagonist, Lyle, is thinking about the nests while the poultry return, which triggers their attack. In the source story and story A, the reason for the chickens' or poultry's aggression is not explicitly stated.

Given these similarities and differences, both stories A and B can be considered analogous to the source story, as they share the core elements of an unexpected attack on the protagonist and a theft occurring while the protagonist is dealing with the aggressive behavior of their birds.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>","Both story A and story B are analogous to the source story in terms of the main plot elements: a character who desires a salary increase, the announcement of a salary increase for a higher-ranking official, and the character taking extreme measures in response due to perceived unfairness.

In the source story, Mrs. Jackson becomes angry and sets fire to the principal's office. In story A, Professor McGhee becomes upset and blows up the administration building with dynamite. In story B, Professor McGhee becomes impatient and burns down the administration building with kerosene.

However, there are differences in the specific actions taken and the outcomes. In the source story, Mrs. Jackson sets fire to the principal's office but does not mention any consequences for her actions. In story A, Professor McGhee's actions lead to the provost giving himself a raise, which further angers her. In story B, the provost gives himself a raise after the fire, but there is no mention of any consequences for Professor McGhee's actions.

Considering these similarities and differences, I would say that story A is more analogous to the source story, as it shares the key elements of desire for a salary increase, extreme response, and the provost giving himself a raise.

Provide final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>","Both story A and story B are analogous to the source story in terms of the main plot and character motivations. In all three stories, a teacher or professor desires a salary increase, becomes frustrated with the lack of funds for raises, and takes extreme measures to seek revenge on the administration.

In story A, Mrs. Jackson (the teacher) becomes angry and sets fire to the principal's office using gasoline. In story B, Professor Rosie McGhee (the professor) becomes upset and blows up the administration building using dynamite.

However, there are some differences in the details of the stories:

1. In the source story, the principal increases his own salary by 20 percent, while in story A, the provost gives himself a raise after the fire.
2. In the source story, Mrs. Jackson goes to a bar and gets drunk after setting the fire, while in story B, Professor McGhee does not mention any specific actions after the explosion.

Despite these differences, the overall structure and character motivations are similar, making both story A and story B analogous to the source story.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>","Both story A and story B are analogous to the source story, as they share similar themes and events. In each story, a snake (Pierre the cobra in the source story, Gene the rattlesnake in stories A and B) encounters a bird (a falcon in the source story, a raven in stories A and B) and reacts defensively by biting the bird. The bird then grabs the snake and flies with it, but due to the snake's bite, the bird becomes weak and they both fall to their deaths.

However, there are some differences between the stories:

- In the source story, the snake (Pierre) initiates the conflict by striking the falcon, while in stories A and B, the bird (raven) initiates the conflict by grabbing the snake.
- In the source story, the falcon is teaching Pierre a lesson by flying away with him, while in stories A and B, the raven is trying to set the snake straight by grabbing it.

Despite these differences, the overall structure and themes of the stories are similar, making both story A and story B analogous to the source story.

Provide final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>","Both story A and story B are analogous to the source story in different ways. 

In story A, the roles are reversed compared to the source story. Here, the rattlesnake (Gene) is the one who bites the raven, causing it to become weak and fall from the sky. This story is analogous to the source story in terms of the conflict between the two animals and their eventual demise due to their actions.

In story B, the events are more similar to the source story. Here, the raven grabs the rattlesnake (Gene) and takes it into the air, just like the falcon did with the cobra in the source story. The rattlesnake then bites the raven, causing it to become weak and fall from the sky, mirroring the cobra's actions in the source story.

So, both story A and story B can be considered analogous to the source story, but in different ways. Story A is more of a reversal of roles, while story B is more directly analogous to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",B,B,True,5.480707168579102,8.527301788330078
