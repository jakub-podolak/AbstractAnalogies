Only one answer is correct.","1. In all three stories, the protagonists have a strong desire for something (gingerbread for William, graduation and Hawaii trip for Karen) but fail to achieve it due to their current situation (William's messy room, Karen's poor academic performance). The promises made by authority figures (nurse and father) serve as incentives to improve themselves, but they ultimately fall short.

2. In both stories, the characters have a negative attitude towards the institutions they are in (hospital for William, high school for Karen). Their daydreaming and lack of focus on their immediate goals hinder their progress. The father figures in the stories act as motivators, but their promises do not guarantee success.

3. The narrative structure of all three stories follows a similar pattern: the protagonist has a strong desire, they are given an incentive, they fail to achieve their goal, and they are left disappointed.

4. Both Story A and Story B share more similarities with the Source Story than Story A alone. In both stories, the characters have a negative attitude towards their current situation, they are given an incentive to improve, they fail to achieve their goal, and they are left disappointed.

Only one answer is correct.","1. In all three stories, the protagonists have a strong desire for something external that motivates them to make an effort to improve their situation. In Story A and the Source Story, the incentive is a reward (gingerbread and freedom from confinement), while in Story B, it is a trip (Hawaii). However, in all cases, the protagonists ultimately fail to achieve their goal due to their inability to focus on the task at hand.
2. The characters in all three stories share a common trait of being easily distracted and preferring to daydream or focus on their desires rather than taking action to improve their situation. William, Karen in Story A, and Karen in Story B all struggle with their current circumstances and have a strong desire for something that seems out of reach.

Only one answer is correct.","1. In all three stories, an innovation leads to an accident that causes harm to the person responsible for implementing it. In response, the inventor or supplier recommends a safety feature or warning label to prevent similar accidents in the future. The person in charge initially disregards the recommendation but changes their mind after experiencing the accident themselves. They then implement the safety feature or warning label out of fear and a newfound appreciation for its importance.

2. In both Story A and the Source Story, the characters are managers or people in charge of implementing new products. They initially disregard the safety feature or warning label but change their minds after experiencing an accident. In Story B, the character's initial disregard for the warning labels is explained by her belief that it would be too much trouble to make them. This aspect is not present in the Source Story.

3. The narrative structure of all three stories follows a similar pattern: an innovation leads to an accident, the inventor or supplier recommends a safety feature or warning label, and the person in charge initially disregards it but changes their mind after experiencing the accident.

Only one answer is correct.","1. In all three stories, a character makes a boastful statement about having someone or something that will ensure a certain need is met, only to find themselves in a situation where that need goes unmet. In response, the character takes actions to remedy the situation, leading to unintended consequences.

2. In Story A, Joseph's character development involves his growing frustration and desperation when his first chauffeur fails to show up, leading him to hire a second one to avoid future inconvenience. This mirrors the source story's theme of a character's desire for control and security.

In Story B, Alexander's character development is driven by his initial disappointment and hunger, which leads him to marry a second wife in an attempt to ensure a constant food supply. This can be seen as an escalation of his initial boastful statement, highlighting the theme of excessive desire and its potential consequences.

3. Both stories share a similar narrative structure, with the character making a boastful statement, experiencing a situation that contradicts their assumption, and then taking actions to prevent a recurrence of the issue.

Only one answer is correct.","1. In the source story, an old hawk named Karla offers her feathers to a hunter to prevent him from shooting at her. In Story A, a small country named Zerdia sells its computers to its warlike neighbor, Gagrach, to prevent an attack. In Story B, Zerdia sells a supercomputer to Gagrach, but later realizes that it was used to guide missiles during a surprise attack. The themes in all three stories involve conflict resolution through negotiation or compromise.

2. In the source story, Karla is an old hawk who values her life and decides to offer her feathers to a hunter to prevent being shot. The hunter is portrayed as a simple, unsophisticated man who is grateful for Karla's offer and keeps his promise.

In Story B, Zerdia is also a small country with advanced technology, but it is portrayed as naive for trusting Gagrach and ultimately betrayed.

3. The narrative structure of the source story is simple and straightforward. It involves a conflict between Karla and the hunter, a resolution through negotiation, and a happy ending. In Story A, the narrative structure is similar, but it involves a larger scale conflict between two countries and a resolution through trade. In Story B, the narrative structure is more complex, as it involves a betrayal of trust and a surprise attack.

Only one answer is correct.","1. In all three stories, the protagonists (Percy, Sam) travel or go on a journey, and upon their return, they encounter a disappointment from someone they expect to help them (squirrel, mother). In both Story A and Story B, the protagonist offers a gift in return for a favor, but the person they approach is not impressed and refuses to help. The themes of disappointment, unappreciation, and the struggle for support or resources are present in all three stories.

2. In the Source Story, Percy's singing ability is the focus, and he is disappointed when his talent is not appreciated. In Story A, Sam's actions during his travels are the source of his mother's disappointment, and in Story B, the gift he brings back from Tibet is deemed worthless. In all three stories, the protagonist experiences a setback and reacts with sadness or determination.

3. The narrative structure of the Source Story is straightforward and simple, focusing on the interaction between Percy and the squirrel. In both Story A and Story B, the structure is similar, with Sam's journey and return home framing the story, and the encounter with his mother being the pivotal moment.

4. Based on the comparisons, both Story A and Story B share similarities with the Source Story in terms of themes and narrative structure. However, Story B more closely resembles the Source Story as it includes the element of a gift being offered and rejected, which is present in the Source Story.

When the object begins to wither or becomes ill, the owner faces the loss of the source of joy. In stories A and B, the object is saved and revived by being given to someone else who takes good care of it, resulting in the return of the joy it brings.
2. In the source story, Beedle values his choice apricot tree and shares its fruit with others. When the tree withers, he is unhappy and resolves the issue by giving it to the judge who takes good care of it and revives the tree. In story A, Mr. Gerson values his canary and shares its songs with others. When the canary falls ill, he is unhappy and resolves the issue by selling it to a veterinarian who takes good care of it and revives the canary. In both stories, the owners face the loss of their source of joy but find a solution that results in the return of the joy.
3. The narrative structure of all three stories is similar in that they all involve a valuable object that brings joy to the owner and those around them, the loss of that joy due to the object's withering or illness, and the resolution of the issue through the transfer of ownership to someone who takes good care of the object and revives it.

Only one answer is correct.","1. In all three stories, a character (Mrs. Jackson in the source story, McGhee in stories A and B) becomes frustrated or angry due to perceived injustice or unfairness, and decides to take revenge. The revenge takes the form of destructive actions (setting fire to the principal's office in the source story, blowing up the captain's cabin in stories A and B).

2. In the source story, Mrs. Jackson's character is portrayed as being desperate and vengeful, with her actions being driven by anger and a desire to get back at the principal. Similarly, in stories A and B, McGhee's character is also portrayed as being desperate and vengeful, with his actions being driven by anger and a desire to get back at the captain.

3. The narrative structure of all three stories is similar in that they each have a clear conflict (the principal not giving teachers a salary increase in the source story, the captain denying McGhee vacation in stories A and B), a build-up of tension leading to the character's decision to take revenge, and a climax where the revenge is carried out.

4. Based on the comparisons, story B is more closely related to the source story as it shares the same elements of frustration, revenge, and destructive actions, with the only difference being the specific context and characters involved.
