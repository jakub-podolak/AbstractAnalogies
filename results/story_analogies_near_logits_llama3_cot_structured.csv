The Source Story and Story A share a similar theme of a hawk/eagle offering its feathers to a hunter/sportsman to spare its life. The theme is one of self-sacrifice and peaceful resolution. Story B, on the other hand, has a darker theme, where the eagle's trust is betrayed, and it ultimately meets its demise.

In Story A, Zerdia, the eagle, also takes initiative to donate her tailfeathers, but her character development is not as prominent. In Story B, Zerdia's character is more passive, and her trust is ultimately misplaced. The relationships between the characters in Story A and Story B are less nuanced and less effective than in the Source Story.

The theme of appreciation and care for the tree/vine is also present in both stories. In contrast, Story A has a different theme, where the vine is moved and withers away, leading to disappointment.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Beedle is a kind farmer who values his apricot tree and shares its fruit with others. The judge is a character who appreciates the tree and takes care of it, leading to its revival. In Story B, Mr. Gerson is a grower who values his grapevine and shares its grapes with friends. The mayor is a character who appreciates the vine and takes care of it, leading to its revival. The relationships and character development in Story B align more closely with those in the Source Story. In Story A, the characters' motivations and actions are different, and the relationships are not as well-developed.

All three stories share a common theme: a prisoner's attempt to escape or break a rule, which ultimately leads to their capture. The source story and Story A both feature a prisoner who is told to do something (play harmonica/kazoo during the day) and then gets caught when they follow the advice. Story B, on the other hand, has a prisoner who refuses to follow the advice and is caught because of their own superstition.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the source story, Morris is a simple-minded prisoner who is told to play harmonica during the day by his cellmate. In Story A, Denny is also a prisoner who is told to play the kazoo during the day by his cellmate. In Story B, Denny is a prisoner who is told to play the kazoo during the day, but he refuses to listen. The relationships between the prisoners and their cellmates are similar in all three stories, with the cellmate serving as a catalyst for the prisoner's actions.
