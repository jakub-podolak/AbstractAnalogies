Let's think step by step.","Both stories A and B describe a situation where an individual has a goal that they are motivated to achieve, but ultimately fail to do so due to their current situation. In the source story, William's goal is to pass the room inspections and receive gingerbread, while in stories A and B, Karen's goal is to graduate from high school and go on a vacation to Hawaii.

However, the key similarity between the source story and story A is that in both cases, the individuals are motivated by an external reward (gingerbread and a trip to Hawaii, respectively) that they are unable to achieve because they do not put in the necessary effort to meet the requirements (cleaning their room and passing their classes). In story B, while the external motivation is still present, the primary focus is on Karen's dislike of school and how it prevented her from passing her classes, rather than the reward itself.

Story A is about a company (Quiggly Co.) that enters a new market (integrated circuits) and makes a significant investment (a space factory) in order to compete, without fully understanding the risks and costs involved. They end up losing a lot of money, and abandon the new market in favor of their old one.

This is story A:

Cornelius was an astronomer who thought about nothing but astronomy. He was obsessed with stars and galaxies.
His wife Agatha complained that he was spending too much time on astronomy and not enough on maintaining his own house. As a result, the roof was gradually leaking more and more and the house was becoming almost unlivable. But Cornelius would not listen.
Then, one evening when Cornelius was walking through his house, a rotten floor collapsed under his weight. Cornelius was severely injured but the accident showed him that Agatha had been right all along. He decided to try to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.

This is story B:

Cornelius was an astronomer who thought about nothing but astronomy. He was obsessed with stars and galaxies. Gradually he was turning his home into an observatory.
But before he was finished his wife Agatha complained that he was spending too much time renovating the house and not enough on his job which was astronomy. As a result, the house was no longer livable. Cornelius decided that Agatha was right and he went back to thinking about nothing but astronomy.
Then, one evening when Cornelius was walking through his house, an unfinished floor collapsed under his weight. Cornelius was severely injured but the accident showed him that he should try to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.

Let's think step by step.","Both stories A and B involve an individual who is so focused on their obsession or passion that they neglect other important aspects of their life, leading to negative consequences for themselves. In the source story, King Otto's obsession with rebuilding bridges for military purposes overshadows his neglect of military campaigns and results in his own injury. In story A, Cornelius's obsession with astronomy causes him to neglect maintaining his house, leading to a dangerous collapse.

Therefore, both stories are analogous to the source story and neither tag specifically is correct. However, for the sake of clarity, I would recommend tagging both A and B as the answer.

Story A is about an old man (Zebediah) who gives up some money to escape from a thief and then buys weapons (implied by ""he bought a blunderbuss"") to protect himself from future theft.

Story B is about an old man (Zebediah) who tries to scare away a beggar and ends up giving him some money to escape, but later discovers that some money is still missing.

While both stories involve an old man giving up something of value to escape danger, only story A follows the pattern of the source story, in which the protagonist makes a sacrifice in the moment to save himself and then takes action to prevent future incidents.

In story A, the unexpected event is a tidal wave washing away the sleeping bags. In story B, the unexpected event is also a tidal wave, but it happens before Linda comes back, and the girls attacking her is a separate event.

Therefore, neither story A nor story B is exactly analogous to the source story, as they have different unexpected events.

The source story involves chickens attacking their farmer for unknown reasons, which could be seen as a metaphor for unexpected adversity. In Stories A and B, the camp director and Mark are both dealing with unexpected problems (missing sleeping bags and attacking chickens, respectively) and becoming frustrated with those around them in the heat of the moment.

Once there was a teacher named Mrs. Jackson who wanted a salary increase. One day, the principal said that he was increasing his own salary by 20 percent. However, he said, there was not enough money to give the teachers a salary increase.
When Mrs. Jackson heard this she became so angry that she decided to take revenge. The next day, Mrs. Jackson used gasoline to set fire to the principal's office. Then she went to a bar and got drunk.

This is story A:

McGhee was a sailor who wanted a few days of vacation on land. One day McGhee became so impatient that he tried to blow up the captain's cabin using dynamite.
After this incident, the captain announced that he would be taking a vacation in the mountains. However, he said, everyone else would have to remain on board to repair the ship.

This is story B:

McGhee was a sailor who wanted a few days of vacation on land. One day, the captain announced that he would be taking a vacation in the mountains. However, he said, everyone else would have to remain on the ship.
After McGhee heard this he became so upset that he decided to get revenge. Within an hour McGhee blew up the captain's cabin with dynamite.

Let's think step by step.","Both stories involve a character wanting something (a salary increase for Mrs. Jackson, a few days of vacation for McGhee) and becoming angered or frustrated when it is denied. In response, they take extreme and destructive action against the person or persons denying them. The parallel elements are:

1. Desire for something
2. Frustration or anger
3. Revengeful action

Both stories correspond to the source story, but we should consider which one has more significant similarities. While the actions in story A and the source story differ in their methods (arson vs. dynamite), the underlying motivation, the severity of the response, and the fact that the actions result in a form of punishment to the denier are all present in both stories.

<ans> A and B </ans>

However, given that the source story refers to a teacher named Mrs. Jackson, the parallel elements in story A have a closer match due to it being about a teacher (Mrs. Jackson) rather than a sailor (McGhee) in story B.

Let's think step by step.","In the source story, there is a conflict between Pierre the cobra and the falcon. Each story in A/B has a conflict between a character (Gene in stories A and B, and Pierre in the source story) and another character or authority figure (a policeman in stories A and B, and a falcon in the source story).

In the source story, Pierre strikes the falcon out of fear, and in both stories A and B, the secondary character reacts by taking the primary character (Gene) with them against their will.

In the source story, both the cobra and the falcon ultimately meet their demise due to the falcon's inability to fly after being injured. In stories A and B, both the primary character (Gene) and the secondary character (the policeman) meet their demise when the policeman loses control of the vehicle.

Taking these similarities into account, both stories A and B are analogous to the source story.

Let's think step by step.","In the source story, the cobra attacks the falcon in self-defense, and both animals die as a result. In story A, Gene attacks the policeman unprovoked, and they both die as a result. In story B, Gene attacks the policeman unprovoked, but the policeman attempts to take him somewhere safe before they both die in an accident.

Although both stories involve unprovoked attacks leading to the deaths of two characters, only in story A are the deaths directly attributable to the attacks, as in the source story. Therefore, the answer is:
