Story A is the most analogous to the source story. In both stories, the main character (William in the source story and Kevin in Story A) is a patient in a mental institution who dislikes cleaning their room and fails the room inspections. They both spend most of their time daydreaming and are motivated by the promise of a treat (gingerbread in the source story and a cake in Story A) to clean their rooms. However, in both stories, they are unable to complete the task in time and do not receive the promised treat. Story B, on the other hand, focuses more on Kevin's desire for the cake and his lack of action in cleaning his room, which is not as closely aligned with the source story's emphasis on the room inspections and the character's struggle with cleaning.<|end_of_turn|>",A,A,False,,

Story B is the most analogous to the source story. In both stories, the manager/director experiences a severe injury while using a new, sharp blade. This incident leads them to consider the safety feature necessary and have it developed immediately, despite initial reservations about its cost or necessity.

Story A is the most analogous to the source story. In both stories, a smaller country (Bolon/Moreland) decides to take over a neighboring country (Salam/Lincoln) to make the best of a difficult situation. Both countries then propose a treaty with their aggressive neighbor (Mayonia/Chad), offering control over the conquered country in exchange for their own independence. However, the aggressive neighbor (Mayonia/Chad) invades both countries anyway, ultimately installing puppet governments and taking control.

Story B is not as analogous because it involves Moreland offering to help conquer Lincoln instead of attempting to take it over themselves. Additionally, the outcome is different, with Chad invading both countries regardless of the agreement between Moreland and Lincoln.<|end_of_turn|>",A,A,False,,

Story A is analogous to the source story. In both stories, the ruler (King Otto in the source story and Emperor Cornelius in Story A) is obsessed with war and conquest, neglecting other important aspects of their kingdom (bridges and roads, respectively). Both rulers experience a significant accident (crashing through an unfinished bridge and an overpass collapse) that leads them to realize the importance of balancing their spending between military and domestic expenditures. In contrast, Story B does not have the same level of analogy as the source story, as Emperor Cornelius ultimately returns to his obsession with war after the accident.<|end_of_turn|>",A,B,False,,

Story B is the most analogous to the source story. In both stories, the protagonist (Frederick in the source story and Zebediah in Story B) is tending their flock near a forest when a dangerous predator (a lion in the source story and a tiger in Story B) appears. Both protagonists try to scare the predator away with shouting, but this only attracts the predator's attention. They then give the predator a lamb/calf to distract it and lead the rest of their flock to safety. However, in both stories, they later discover that another animal is missing.

While Story A also involves a shepherd, a predator, and the loss of an animal, the key differences are that the protagonist (Zebediah) is not tending his flock near a forest and he does not give the predator a second animal to distract it. Instead, he confronts the predator directly, which leads to a more dangerous situation. Therefore, Story B is more analogous to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",B,B,False,,
