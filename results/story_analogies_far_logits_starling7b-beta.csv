The source story and story A are analogous because in both stories, one character (Ivan/Christine) makes a mistake that upsets the other character (Boris/John). In both stories, the upset character demands that the other character not handle certain responsibilities (money/driving the car). However, in story B, Christine's actions are more malicious and intentional, which is not the case in the source story or story A. Therefore, story A is more analogous to the source story.

However, in story A, the bird recovers and continues to sing beautifully, while in story B, the bird becomes ill and dies after being moved. This makes story A more analogous to the source story, as it has a happier ending.

In both stories, the main character later realizes that the situation is not completely resolved and that something else is missing (a lamb and another bag of coins).

The story B is not analogous to the source story because in this story, the dangerous situation (the beggar) comes after the main character (Zebediah) has already fallen asleep and woken up.

McGhee was a sailor who wanted a few days of vacation on land. One day, the captain announced that he would be taking a vacation in the mountains. However, he said, everyone else would have to remain on the ship.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?

In story B, McGhee's actions lead to the captain's decision to take a vacation in the mountains. This is similar to the source story, where Mrs. Jackson's actions lead to the principal's decision to increase his own salary. In both stories, the characters take extreme measures to get what they want, and their actions have unintended consequences. In story A, the captain's decision to take a vacation in the mountains is made independently of McGhee's actions, and there is no direct connection between the two events. Therefore, story B is more analogous to the source story.

In addition, both stories involve characters who are frustrated with their current situations and take extreme measures to try to change them. In the source story, Mrs. Jackson is frustrated with her lack of a salary increase and takes revenge by setting fire to the principal's office. In story B, McGhee is frustrated with his lack of vacation time and tries to blow up the captain's cabin. In both cases, the characters' actions have negative consequences and do not achieve their desired outcomes. This further supports the analogy between the source story and story B.

The source story and story B are analogous because in both stories, the characters (Gene and the policeman) are involved in a conflict that leads to their deaths.

In both stories, the conflict escalates and results in the death of both characters. Additionally, the source story and story B both involve a lesson or consequence for the characters' actions. In the source story, the falcon teaches the cobra a lesson by flying away with it, while in story B, the policeman teaches Gene a lesson by driving away with him.
