Only one answer is correct.","After analyzing the stories, I can see that both stories A and B have similar elements to the source story. However, upon closer inspection, I notice that story B is more analogous to the source story.

Here's why:

* Both stories feature a shut-in (William/ Kevin) who dislikes cleaning their room.
* Both stories have a promise of a treat (gingerbread/cake) as an incentive to clean the room.
* Both stories result in the shut-in not cleaning their room in time and not receiving the treat.
* Both stories feature the shut-in being unhappy and sulking as a result.

Story A is similar, but it lacks the detail about the shut-in spending time daydreaming about the treat, which is present in both the source story and story B.

Moreland decided to make the best of the situatuion by offering to help conquer Lincoln in exchange for being left alone itself.
But Lincoln somehow received word of the agreement and began to seek protection from other powerful nations. Immediately, Moreland invaded Lincloln and eventually succeeded in conquering it.
When Chad got into the action it invaded both Lincoln and Moreland. And Moreland was so drained from battle, it could do nothing to prevent it.

This is story B:

Two weak nations, Lincoln and Moreland, bordered a third nation known as Chad. Chad was aggressive and very powerful.Moreland decided to make the best of the situation by overpowering Lincoln. Lincoln started to seek protection from other powerful nations but Moreland eventually succeeded in conquering it.
Then triumphant Moreland offered to make a pact with its aggressive neighbor Chad. Moreland offered to give Chad control over Lincoln in exchange for being left alone itself.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Only one answer is correct.","After analyzing the stories, I can see that Story B is analogous to the source story.

Here's why:

* In the source story, Bolon takes over Salam, and then proposes a treaty with Mayonia, offering to give Mayonia control over Salam in exchange for a guarantee of independence.
* In Story B, Moreland takes over Lincoln, and then proposes a pact with Chad, offering to give Chad control over Lincoln in exchange for being left alone itself.

Both stories follow a similar pattern of a weaker nation taking over a neighboring nation, and then attempting to negotiate with a more powerful neighbor to secure their own independence. However, in both cases, the more powerful neighbor ultimately invades and takes control of both nations.

Frederick the shepherd was tending his flock at the edge of a forest. Suddenly, a lion appeared out of the forest. Frederick was really scared so he started shouting to scare the lion away. But the shouting did nothing but attract the lion's attention and it began walking towards him. He then realized he should have left it alone. 
 To escape, Frederick gave the lion a lamb. While the lion was occupied, he led the rest of the flock away. Eventually, he guessed they were far enough away to be safe from the lion. So he took a nap on the grass.
 However, when he awoke he notice another lamb was missing and he could not find it anywhere! At the next opportunity, Frederick bought a blunderbuss so he could better defend his flock in the future.

This is story A:

Zebediah the cowherd was watching over his herd and he dozed off. When he awoke he discovered that one calf was missing. He could not find it anywhere. Zebediah figured that the thief was still nearby so he started yelling for whoever stole the calf to show his face.
 Suddenly a monstrous tiger came out of the woods and started walking towards him. Zebediah was surprised and very frightened. He wished he had left the tiger alone.
 To escape, he gave the tiger a second calf. While the tiger was occupied, Zebediah took the remainder of the herd to a safer place!

Only one answer is correct.","After analyzing the stories, I can see that both stories A and B have similar plot elements to the source story. However, upon closer inspection, I notice that story B has a more direct match with the source story.

In the source story, Frederick gives the lion a lamb to distract it while he escapes with the rest of the flock. Similarly, in story B, Zebediah gives the tiger a calf to distract it while he escapes with the remainder of the herd.

In contrast, story A has some differences in the sequence of events. Zebediah gives the tiger a second calf, which is not present in the source story.

Here's why:

* In the source story, Mark is collecting eggs when his chickens return and attack him. In story B, Lyle is thinking about what to do when his poultry return and attack him.
* In both stories, the protagonist is surprised and injured by the sudden attack from their own animals.
* In both stories, the animals are motivated by a desire to get something (eggs or nests) that is no longer available to them.
* In both stories, the protagonist is forced to flee from the animals and deal with the aftermath of the attack.

Story A, on the other hand, is not analogous to the source story. In story A, the poultry are attacking Lyle while he is thinking about his nests, but there is no equivalent event in the source story where Mark is collecting eggs.
