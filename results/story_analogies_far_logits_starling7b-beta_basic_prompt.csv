In the source story, William is a patient in a psychiatric hospital who struggles with keeping his room clean and passes his time daydreaming about food. The nurse promises him gingerbread as an incentive to clean his room, but he fails to do so in time and doesn't receive the reward.

Story A is analogous to the source story in the sense that both involve a character (Karen and William) who struggles with their current situation (high school and psychiatric hospital) and has a strong desire for something else (vacation to Hawaii and gingerbread). However, in story A, Karen fails to improve her grades and doesn't get to go to Hawaii, similar to how William fails to clean his room and doesn't get the gingerbread.

Story B is also analogous to the source story in that both involve a character (Karen and William) who struggles with their current situation and has a strong desire for something else (vacation to Hawaii and gingerbread). In this story, Karen's failure to pass enough classes and graduate results in her not going to Hawaii, mirroring William's failure to clean his room and receive the gingerbread.

In conclusion, both story A and story B are analogous to the source story, as they share similar themes of struggle, desire, and failure to achieve the desired outcome due to procrastination or inability to change their circumstances.<|end_of_turn|>",B,A,True,6.054717063903809,8.27344036102295

In story A, the situation is more similar to the source story. Just like Mr. Newton in the source story, Ms. Boyce in story A initially dismisses the need for safety features (warning labels) but changes her mind after experiencing an accident (getting seriously burned). This change of heart leads to the implementation of the safety feature (warning labels) in the product (sun lamps).

In story B, the sequence of events is slightly different but still follows the same general pattern. Ms. Boyce experiences an accident (getting seriously burned) after which the supplier recommends a safety feature (warning labels). This prompts Ms. Boyce to consider the labels necessary and have them printed immediately.

So, both stories A and B can be considered analogous to the source story, but story A is more directly analogous due to the similarity in the sequence of events and the change in perspective after the accident.

Similarly, in story A, Alexander's overconfidence in his two wives' cooking led to him going hungry, and his solution of marrying a second wife did not solve the problem.

In story B, the main theme is the importance of communication and understanding in relationships. Alexander's wife misunderstood his intentions, leading to him going hungry.

In both the source story and story B, there is a partnership between two individuals (Boris and Ivan in the source story, and John and Christine in story B) who love each other and decide to join forces in some capacity. In both stories, one of the individuals (Ivan in the source story, and Christine in story B) exhibits reckless behavior that causes problems for the partnership (Ivan losing money, Christine denting the car). As a result, the other individual (Boris in the source story, John in story B) places restrictions on the reckless individual's involvement in certain aspects of their shared endeavor (no involvement in monetary matters for Ivan, no driving of the car for Christine).

While story A does involve a couple and a car, the reckless behavior (denting the car on purpose) is not an accident and the consequences are different (John being hurt), making it less analogous to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",B,B,False,,

In both the source story and story A, we see a smaller country (Bolon or Moreland) attempting to make the best of a difficult situation by aligning with a more powerful entity (Salam or Lincoln). However, this alliance ultimately leads to the smaller entity being overpowered and controlled by the larger entity (Mayonia or Chad). Additionally, the smaller entity's focus on maintaining control over the other (Bolon trying to control Salam or Moreland trying to control Lincoln) prevents them from effectively resisting the larger entity's takeover.

King Otto was a warmonger who was obsessed with conquest and riches. One year he decided to rebuild all the bridges of the kingdom to make them strong enough for all his armies.
Otto's counselor, the chamberlain, complained that he was spending too much money on the. bridges and not enough on actual military campaigns. Because of all the construction too many of the bridges were out of commission being worked on. Otto decided that the chamberlain was right and he abandoned the bridge project to mount a full-scale invasion of a neighboring country.
Then one day when King Otto was travelling through his kingdom his carriage crashed through an unfinished bridge. He was severely injured but the mishap made it clear to him that he needed to balance his military and domestic expenditures.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>","Both story A and story B are analogous to the source story in different ways. 

In story A, the situation is more similar to the source story. Just like King Otto, Cornelius is obsessed with his work (astronomy) and neglects his domestic responsibilities (maintaining his house). The accident (collapsed floor) serves as a wake-up call for Cornelius, just as the carriage crash did for King Otto. Both characters learn the importance of balancing their interests after the accidents.

In story B, the situation is somewhat different. Cornelius is also obsessed with astronomy, but his wife Agatha complains about him spending too much time on house renovations instead of astronomy. This is a reversal of the source story, where King Otto's counselor complains about him spending too much money on bridge construction instead of military campaigns. However, the accident (collapsed floor) still serves as a wake-up call for Cornelius, and he learns the importance of balancing his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.

So, both stories A and B have elements that are analogous to the source story, but story A is more directly analogous due to the similarity in the characters' obsessions and the consequences of their actions.

Provide final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>","The story that is most analogous to the source story is story B. 

In both the source story and story B, the main character becomes upset due to a perceived unfairness (Mrs. Jackson with the salary increase, and McGhee with the vacation opportunity). They both decide to take revenge, with Mrs. Jackson setting fire to the principal's office and McGhee attempting to blow up the captain's cabin. Additionally, in both stories, the person in authority (the principal and the captain) later announces a decision that affects the other characters (the teachers and the sailors) in a way that may be seen as furthering the initial unfairness.

33,"Once there was a teacher named Mrs. Jackson who wanted a salary increase. One day, the principal said that he was increasing his own salary by 20 percent. However, he said, there was not enough money to give the teachers a salary increase.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>","The analogous story to the source story is <ans> B </ans>.

In both the source story and story B, the main character (Mrs. Jackson in the source story and McGhee in story B) becomes frustrated with their situation and decides to take revenge. In the source story, Mrs. Jackson sets fire to the principal's office after hearing about his salary increase but not receiving one herself. In story B, McGhee uses dynamite to blow up the captain's cabin after learning that he will be going on vacation while the rest of the crew has to remain on the ship.

While story A also involves a character seeking revenge, the situation and the actions taken are different. In story A, McGhee tries to blow up the captain's cabin before the captain announces his vacation plans, and the crew is not forced to remain on the ship. Therefore, story B is more analogous to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",B,B,False,,

In both the source story and story B, there is a conflict between two characters (a cobra and a falcon in the source story, and a young boy and a policeman in story B) that leads to a dangerous situation. In both stories, the characters end up in a perilous situation due to their actions, ultimately leading to their demise. Additionally, the source story and story B both involve a lesson or consequence for the characters' actions.

In contrast, story A does not have the same level of analogous elements to the source story.
