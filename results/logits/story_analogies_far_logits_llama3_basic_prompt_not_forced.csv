Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Only one answer is correct.","After analyzing the stories, I can see that Story B is analogous to the source story.

Here's why:

* In both stories, a weaker party (Moreland) tries to make the best of a bad situation by proposing a deal to a stronger party (Chad).
* In both stories, the stronger party takes advantage of the weaker party's proposal and ends up robbing both of them.
* In both stories, the weaker party is left exhausted and unable to prevent the robbery.

In contrast, Story A does not have the same dynamics. Moreland's proposal to help Chad rob Lincoln is not a desperate attempt to make the best of a bad situation, but rather a misguided attempt to protect himself. Additionally, Moreland's exhaustion is not the direct result of his own actions, but rather a consequence of the chase.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Only one answer is correct.","After analyzing the stories, I can see that both stories A and B have similar plot structures and themes to the source story. However, upon closer inspection, I notice that story B is more analogous to the source story.

Here's why:

* In both the source story and story B, the protagonist (Frederick/Zebediah) is initially frightened and tries to scare the predator (lion/beggar) away, but this only attracts its attention.
* In both stories, the protagonist then tries to distract the predator with a sacrifice (giving a lamb/throwing a bag of coins) to escape.
* Finally, in both stories, the protagonist is left feeling vulnerable and surprised by a subsequent event (the missing lamb/another bag of coins gone missing).

Story A, on the other hand, has some differences in the plot structure and tone. While it shares some similarities with the source story, it's not as analogous.
