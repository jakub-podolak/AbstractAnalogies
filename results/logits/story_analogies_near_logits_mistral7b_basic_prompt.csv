Explanation: Both stories A and B have similarities with the source story. However, in story A, the promise of gingerbread specifically motivates the patient (William) to clean his room, but he fails to do so in time and misses out on the reward. In story B, the promise of a cake motivates the patient (Kevin) to daydream about it instead of cleaning his room, and he also misses out on the reward. The key difference is that in story A, the patient's failure to clean is a result of not having enough time, while in story B, it's a result of daydreaming. However, both stories share the theme of a patient being motivated by the promise of food but ultimately failing to obtain it due to their own actions. Therefore, story A is more analogous to the source story as the primary reason for the patient's failure to obtain the reward is the same (lack of time) as in the source story.</s>",A,B,False,,

Explanation: Both stories A and B have similarities with the source story in that they involve an emperor who is obsessed with war and spending large amounts of money on it, and an advisor who suggests that more money should be spent on domestic projects (bridges in the source story, roads in stories A and B). In both stories, the emperor ignores the advisor's suggestions initially, but then has a personal experience that makes him realize the importance of balancing military and domestic expenditures. The key difference is that in story A, the emperor abandons the bridge project to mount a military campaign, while in the source story, Otto decides to continue both projects.

Frederick the shepherd was tending his flock at the edge of a forest. Suddenly, a lion appeared out of the forest. Frederick was really scared so he started shouting to scare the lion away. But the shouting did nothing but attract the lion's attention and it began walking towards him. He then realized he should have left it alone. 
 To escape, Frederick gave the lion a lamb. While the lion was occupied, he led the rest of the flock away. Eventually, he guessed they were far enough away to be safe from the lion. So he took a nap on the grass.
 However, when he awoke he notice another lamb was missing and he could not find it anywhere! At the next opportunity, Frederick bought a blunderbuss so he could better defend his flock in the future.

Explanation: Both stories involve a herdkeeper (Frederick/Zebediah), a predator (lion/tiger), and the predator taking one animal from the herd. However, in story A, the herdkeeper gives the predator an animal to distract it and leads the rest of the herd away. In story B, the herdkeeper also gives the predator an animal to distract it but then falls asleep and discovers another animal missing upon waking up. The key difference is that in story A, the herdkeeper successfully leads the rest of the herd away before taking a nap, while in story B, he does not. Therefore, story A is more analogous to the source story as it follows the sequence of events more closely.</s>",A,B,False,,
