Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?

<ans> A </ans>

The reason is that both stories A and the source story share the same pattern:

1. The protagonist is not motivated to take action due to a lack of interest in their current situation (high school or hospital life).
2. A promise of a reward (gingerbread or trip to Hawaii) is made to motivate them to take action.
3. Despite the promise, the protagonist fails to take action or achieve their goal due to their lack of motivation or procrastination.

Story B does not fit this pattern, as Karen's father's promise actually motivates her to daydream and prepare for her trip, rather than motivating her to take action in her schoolwork.",A,A

Provide final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>","The stories A and B are analogous to the source story.

In all three stories, a weaker party (Bolon/Salam/Moreland) tries to make the best of a difficult situation by making a deal with a stronger party (Mayonia/Chad). However, the stronger party ends up taking advantage of the weaker party and ultimately controls both parties.

The key similarities between the stories are:

* The weaker party tries to negotiate with the stronger party to avoid being taken over/robbed.
* The stronger party takes advantage of the weaker party's vulnerability and ends up controlling both parties.
* The weaker party is unable to prevent the stronger party from taking control due to their own actions (e.g. Bolon is busy maintaining control of Salam, Moreland is busy holding Lincoln down).

Therefore, both stories A and B are analogous to the source story.",,A

1. The main character (Linda) is in a situation where they are supposed to be in charge (directing a camp).
2. The situation escalates when the girl scouts return and start asking questions, leading Linda to become frustrated and scream.
3. A sudden event occurs (a tidal wave hits the beach), which creates a new problem.
4. Linda runs away, and the girl scouts follow her.

In contrast, story B has some differences:

1. The tidal wave hits the beach before Linda returns, which changes the order of events.
2. The girl scouts are more focused on their sleeping bags being washed away, rather than asking questions.
