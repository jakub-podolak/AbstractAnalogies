In stories A and B, Alfred is on vacation in a new place (Hawaii) but he is not a newcomer to the area. Also, in the source story, Peter's sunburn is described as second degree burns, while in stories A and B, the sunburn is just described as terrible and requiring medication.

Based on these similarities and differences, both stories A and B can be considered analogous to the source story.

This is story B:

Emperor Cornelius thought about nothing but war. He was obsessed with victory and treasure. One year he decided to renovate all the roads of the empire to make them safe enough for his armed forces.
But before the roads were finished, the emperor's closest advisor, the prime minister, complained that he was spending too much of the royal treasury on the roads and not enough on actual warfare. As a result, the roads were constantly under construction and were seldom usable. Cornelius decided that the prime minister was right and he went back to thinking about nothing but war.
 Then one evening when Cornelius was riding in the countryside, an unmaintained overpass collapsed under his horse-drawn coach. He was severely injured but the accident showed him that he should try to balance his spending between war and maintaining his empire.

Let's think step by step.","Both stories A and B share similarities with the source story. In all three stories, a ruler (King Otto in the source story, Emperor Cornelius in stories A and B) is obsessed with military conquest and riches, and neglects domestic expenditures, such as bridge construction (in the source story) or road maintenance (in stories A and B). The rulers' advisors (the chamberlain in the source story, the prime minister in stories A and B) warn them about the consequences of their spending priorities, but the rulers do not listen. Eventually, the rulers have accidents (a carriage crash through an unfinished bridge in the source story, and an unmaintained overpass collapsing under their coach in stories A and B) that force them to reconsider their priorities and try to balance their military and domestic expenditures.

Therefore, both stories A and B are analogous to the source story.

A cobra called Pierre was slithering through the brush when a falcon came towards it. Pierre became frightened and struck, wounding the falcon in the abdomen. To teach him a lesson, the falcon grabbed the cobra and flew away with it.

Provide final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>

Let's think step by step.","Both stories A and B have the following elements in common with the source story:

1. A snake (Pierre in the source story, Gene in stories A and B) attacks a bird (falcon in the source story, raven in stories A and B).
2. The bird tries to carry the snake away (falcon flies away with Pierre, raven takes Gene to the air).
3. The snake bites the bird during flight (Pierre strikes the falcon, Gene bites the raven).
4. The bird becomes weak due to the snake bite and falls from the sky, resulting in both animals' deaths (falcon and Pierre fall and die, raven and Gene fall and die).

Therefore, both stories A and B are analogous to the source story.

Let's think step by step.","Both stories A and B involve a snake and a bird encountering each other, with the snake biting the bird and both falling from the sky and dying as a result. In the source story, it's a cobra named Pierre and a falcon, while in story A it's a rattlesnake named Gene and a raven, and in story B it's also Gene the rattlesnake and a raven.

Therefore, both stories A and B are analogous to the source story.
