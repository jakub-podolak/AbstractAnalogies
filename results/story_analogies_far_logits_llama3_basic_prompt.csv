In both stories A and B, Ms. Boyce is involved in the introduction of a new heat lamp with a more intense filament, and she suffers a personal injury while using it. This experience leads her to recognize the need for warning labels, which she had previously considered unnecessary.

In contrast, the source story involves Mr. Newton, who is also injured while using a new razor with a sharp metal, and subsequently recognizes the need for a safety feature.
