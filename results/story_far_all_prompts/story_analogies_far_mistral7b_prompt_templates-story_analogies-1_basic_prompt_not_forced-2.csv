Explanation: In both stories, the main character has a strong desire for something external that they can only obtain by meeting certain requirements. In Story A, Karen's desire is to go to Hawaii, and in Story B, William's desire is for gingerbread. However, in Story A, the main character's failure to meet the requirements directly results in her not getting what she wants, just like in the source story. In Story B, the main character spends most of her time preparing for her trip instead of focusing on passing her classes, which ultimately leads to her failing to graduate and not getting to go on the trip. This is not the case in the source story, where William spends most of his time daydreaming and fails to pass the inspection as a result. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story.</s>",,A,A

Explanation: In both stories, an employee is injured after the use of a new product, leading to the implementation of a safety feature or warning label. The similarities between the source story and Story A are more pronounced as both involve an employee's injury, the recommendation of a safety feature, and the subsequent implementation of that feature. Story B, on the other hand, has the supplier recommending the warning label from the start, but the employee initially considers it unnecessary. This deviation from the source story makes Story B less analogous.</s>",,A,A

In both stories, an employee is using a new product that has been recently improved, and they get injured as a result. In both stories, a safety feature or warning label is recommended after the injury to prevent future incidents. The main difference between the stories is that in Story A, the employee initially considered the safety feature unnecessary, while in Story B, the safety feature was recommended by the supplier after the injury occurred. However, in both stories, the employee ultimately comes to consider the safety feature necessary after the injury.

Therefore, Story B is more analogous to the source story because in both stories, an employee gets injured by a new product, a safety feature is recommended after the injury, and the employee ultimately comes to consider the safety feature necessary. The only difference is that in the source story, the employee is the one who recommends the safety feature, while in Story B, the supplier recommends the safety feature. However, the fact that the employee in Story B ultimately comes to the same conclusion as the employee in the source story (that the safety feature is necessary) is the key similarity that makes Story B more analogous to the source story.</s>",,B,B

Explanation: In both stories, there is a man who makes a claim about always having something (Joseph having a reliable chauffeur for his Rolls-Royce, Alexander having two wives to ensure he's always fed), but in each case, they encounter a situation where they don't have what they thought they would. The solution they come up with (hiring an additional chauffeur for Joseph, marrying a second wife for Alexander) results in added expense. However, the key difference is that in Story A, Alexander only has one wife, but she fails to prepare a meal for him. In Story B, Alexander has two wives, but both fail to prepare meals for him. Story A is more analogous to the source story because it follows the same pattern: one person in charge of providing a service or resource, that person failing to do so, and the solution being to hire an additional person to ensure the service or resource is always available.</s>",,A,A

Explanation: In both stories, there is a valuable resource (hawk feathers in the source story and computers in the comparison stories) that is desired by another party (hunter and Gagrach, respectively). In both cases, the owner of the resource offers it to the desiring party in exchange for a promise of non-aggression. The outcome is a peaceful resolution where the attack is called off.

# Source Story:
Peter was a young man from Iceland who moved to Florida one summer. He was very self-conscious about his fair skin. Peter thought that people would not accept him unless he tanned himself golden-brown like every one else.
So Peter spent a whole day in the sun, trying to get a tan. He didn't understand how dangerous the sun could be. Consequently, by evening he had second degree burns over most of his body and he had to go to the hospital. Peter decided that Florida was not for him and booked the next ocean liner back to Iceland. He spent the whole trip under a large umbrella keeping cool.

Explanation: In both stories, the main character (Peter and Quiggly Company) take a risk that turns out to be more dangerous or costly than they anticipated. However, in Story A, Quiggly Company enters a new market (integrated circuits) and decides to invest heavily in a technology that is unfamiliar to them (space manufacturing), not fully understanding the risks and costs involved. This is similar to Peter's decision to try and get a tan in a place where the sun is much stronger than what he is used to, not realizing the risks of sunburn and skin damage. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story. In Story B, Quiggly Company is also warned about the risks of space manufacturing, but they are annoyed at having to play it safe and decide to go back to their old business instead. This is not as directly analogous to the source story, as Peter did not have the option to go back to his old life once he had gotten severely sunburned.</s>",,A,A

Explanation: In both stories, the main character (Peter and Quiggly Company) take a risk that ultimately leads to negative consequences. However, in Story A, Quiggly Company is warned about the risks of entering a new market (space manufacturing) but chooses to ignore the warning and go back to their old business. In Story B, Quiggly Company also enters a new market (integrated circuits) and believes they need to have advanced technology (space factories) to compete, but underestimates the financial risk and ends up losing everything.

The source story is about Peter moving to Florida and trying to get a tan, despite not understanding the dangers of the sun. The comparison stories are about a company entering new markets and underestimating the risks. While the source story and Story A share the theme of taking a risk with unknown consequences, Story B is more analogous as it involves a company entering a new market and underestimating the financial risks, similar to Peter's experience with the sun.</s>",,B,B

Explanation: In both stories, the main characters have a desire for something (pears for Julius, records for Cindy) that they cannot obtain due to financial constraints. The disappointment felt by both characters is a result of this inability to acquire what they want. The key difference between the stories is that in Story A, the characters' disappointment stems from their initial belief that the desired object may be of poor quality, while in Story B, the character expresses a belief that the object is not worth the cost even if she could afford it. However, in the source story, Julius never expresses any doubt about the quality of the pears, only his inability to reach them. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story.</s>",,A,A

Explanation: In both stories, the characters encounter something they desire but cannot obtain due to financial limitations. However, the key difference lies in their thought processes and reactions. In the source story, Julius is initially disappointed because he cannot reach the pears, but he does not dismiss the value of the pears outright. In contrast, in Story B, Cindy initially expresses a doubt about the value of the records, and then becomes disappointed when she cannot afford them. This makes Story B more analogous to the source story, as both involve initial interest or curiosity that is met with disappointment due to financial constraints. Story A, on the other hand, involves the character dismissing the value of the desired object before even attempting to obtain it.</s>",,B,B

In both stories, Sam travels and buys things, but in the source story, Percy sings for the squirrel in exchange for seeds, while in Story B, Sam gives his mother a gift in hopes of receiving a loan. In Story A, the mother's displeasure is directly related to the gift Sam brings, while in the source story, Percy's singing is the cause of the squirrel's disappointment. However, in Story B, the mother's displeasure is not explicitly stated to be related to the gift, but rather to Sam's actions in general.

Explanation: In both stories, one smaller entity (Bolon/Lincoln or Salam/Moreland) is taken over by a larger, more powerful entity (Mayonia/Chad). In Story A, the smaller entity tries to make a deal with the larger entity to avoid being taken over, but ultimately fails and is taken over along with the other smaller entity. In Story B, the smaller entity also tries to make a deal with the larger entity, but ultimately fails and is taken over along with the other smaller entity. The key difference is that in Story A, the smaller entity is initially trying to protect itself from being taken over by the larger entity, while in Story B, the smaller entity is initially trying to help the larger entity take over the other smaller entity. However, the ultimate outcome is the same - both smaller entities are taken over by the larger entity. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story as it more closely mirrors the dynamic of a smaller entity trying to make a deal with a larger, more powerful entity to avoid being taken over, but ultimately failing and being taken over along with another smaller entity.</s>",,A,A

Explanation: Both stories involve a valued pet (tree in source story, canary in comparison stories) and the transfer of ownership to ensure its continued care and survival. In Story A, the outcome is positive with the pet producing desirable results again after being moved. In Story B, the outcome is negative with the pet becoming ill and dying after being moved.

Explanation: In both stories, there is a character who is told to do something differently but ignores the advice and ends up getting into trouble. In Story A, the little girl refuses to play in her own yard because she believes it's bad luck, while in Story B, she goes to the playground instead of doing her chores because she thinks she should always play with her dog in her neighbor's yard. In the source story, Morris is told to play his harmonica during the day but ignores his cellmate and plays at night, leading to his capture.

Explanation: Both stories involve an individual who is obsessed with their work to the point of neglecting other important aspects of their life. In both stories, there is a significant event that causes the individual to realize the importance of balancing their work and personal life. However, in Story A, the wife's complaint about the neglected home leads to the collapse of the floor, while in Story B, the complaint is about the neglected home and the roof, but it is the floor that collapses. The key difference is that in Story A, the wife's complaint is about both the home and the job, while in Story B, it is specifically about the home. The source story involves a king who neglects his domestic expenditures in favor of military campaigns, but there is no mention of his wife complaining about the state of his castle or palace. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story as it involves an individual who is obsessed with their work and neglects their home, leading to a significant event that causes them to realize the importance of balancing their work and personal life.</s>",,A,A

As a result, the house was no longer livable. Cornelius decided that Agatha was right and he went back to thinking about nothing but astronomy.
Then, one evening when Cornelius was walking through his house, an unfinished floor collapsed under his weight. Cornelius was severely injured but the accident showed him that he should try to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.

The reason why Story A is more analogous to the source story is that in both stories, the main character is obsessed with one thing to the point of neglecting other important aspects of their life, leading to an accident that forces them to reconsider their priorities. In Story A, Cornelius is obsessed with astronomy and neglects maintaining his house, leading to a collapsed floor. In the source story, King Otto is obsessed with conquest and riches and neglects maintaining the bridges, leading to a collapsed bridge. Both stories have the same structure and theme of obsession leading to an accident and a change in priorities.</s>",,A,B

Explanation: In both stories, the protagonist initially tries to scare off the threat by shouting, but this only attracts more attention. They then give something valuable to the threat to buy time to escape. However, in Story A, the threat is a beggar, while in Story B, the threat is not explicitly stated and it's inferred to be a thief based on Zebediah's actions. But in the source story, the threat is a lion, which is a completely different type of creature than a beggar or a thief. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story as it involves a similar sequence of events with a comparable type of threat (a person who is initially perceived as dangerous and then is given something to buy time to escape).</s>",,A,A

Explanation: In both stories, there is a leader figure (Mark in the source story and Linda in the comparison stories) who is being attacked or pestered by the group they are leading (chickens in the source story and girl scouts in the comparison stories) while they are trying to solve a problem. However, in Story A, the reason for the group's behavior is due to their own distress and uncertainty, while in Story B, the group's behavior is simply pestering their leader with questions and requests. The source story's chickens attacking Mark is a more direct and unexpected attack compared to the girl scouts' pestering in Story B. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story as it shares the common elements of a leader figure being attacked by their group while trying to solve a problem.</s>",,A,B

# Source Story:
A cobra called Pierre was slithering through the brush when a falcon came towards it. Pierre became frightened and struck, wounding the falcon in the abdomen. To teach him a lesson, the falcon grabbed the cobra and flew away with it.
 Unfortunately for both of them, after they were high above the earth the wounded falcon became too weak to fly. Consequently, they plummeted straight down to the earth and perished. They landed, strangely enough, in the middle of an outdoor wedding ceremony.

# Story A:
Young Gene was walking home from school when a policeman approached him. Suddenly Gene panicked and hit the policeman in the side of the head. The policeman wanted to set the boy straight. He grabbed Gene and drove away with him.
 Unfortunately, once they were on the road the policeman became too dizzy to drive. Consequently, they ran off the road and died when they hit a wall.

# Answer:
Final answer should be in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>","<ans> Neither A nor B are exactly analogous to the source story as there are some key differences. However, if we have to choose, Story B is more similar as both involve a young person (Gene) and a law enforcement officer (policeman), and both result in their unfortunate deaths due to unexpected circumstances. But the source story involves a cobra and a falcon, while Story B involves a human and a policeman, so they are not identical. </ans>

<ans> It's important to note that while Story B is more similar in terms of the elements present (young person, law enforcement officer, unexpected death), the source story and Story A have some similarities as well, such as both involving an animal attack and an unexpected consequence leading to the deaths of the characters. </ans>

<ans> Ultimately, it's important to consider the specific details of each story and how they relate to the source story when making a determination of analogousness. </ans>

# Answer:
Final answer should be in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>","<ans> Neither A nor B are analogous to the source story as there are no significant similarities between them and the source story beyond the elements of a person being taken against their will by an authority figure and both parties meeting an unfortunate end. The source story also includes unique elements such as the animals being in the wild, one being a snake and the other a bird of prey, and the unexpected ending of their demise occurring at a wedding ceremony. </ans>

However, if we were to consider a story that is more analogous to the source story, it would be one where two animals or characters encounter each other in the wild, one becomes aggressive or defensive, and both suffer fatal consequences as a result. Here's an example:

# Story C:
Two stags, Max and Felix, were grazing in the forest when they came across each other. Max, who was in the rutting season, saw Felix as a threat to his territory and charged at him. Felix, feeling threatened, retaliated with his antlers. Both stags sustained injuries and were unable to continue fighting. They weakened and eventually died from their wounds.

Explanation:

The source story and Story C both involve two animals encountering each other in the wild, one becoming aggressive or defensive, and both suffering fatal consequences as a result. In contrast, Story A and Story B involve a person being taken against their will by an authority figure and both parties meeting an unfortunate end, but they do not share the same level of similarity to the source story in terms of the animals in the wild and the unexpected ending.</s>",,B
