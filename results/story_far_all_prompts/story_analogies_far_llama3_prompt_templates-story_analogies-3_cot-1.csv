Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the source story and the two given stories.

The source story is about William, a patient in a psychiatric hospital who is motivated by the promise of gingerbread to clean his room, but ultimately fails to do so and doesn't get the gingerbread.

Story A is about Karen, who is motivated by the promise of a trip to Hawaii to do well in her classes, but ultimately fails to do so and doesn't get the trip.

Story B is also about Karen, who is motivated by the promise of a trip to Hawaii to pass her classes, and she spends most of her time dreaming about Hawaii and preparing for the trip, but ultimately fails to graduate and doesn't get to go.

Now, let's identify the common elements between the source story and the two given stories:

* In all three stories, the main character is motivated by a promise (gingerbread, trip to Hawaii) to achieve a specific goal (cleaning the room, doing well in classes).
* In all three stories, the main character fails to achieve the goal despite being motivated.
* In all three stories, the main character is disappointed and unhappy as a result of not achieving the goal.

Based on these common elements, I would say that Story A is analogous to the source story. Both stories feature a character who is motivated by a promise to achieve a specific goal, but ultimately fails to do so and is disappointed as a result.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Story B is also about Karen, a high school student who loves vacations and is motivated by the promise of a trip to Hawaii to do well in her classes, but ultimately fails to do so and doesn't get to go.

Now, let's compare the source story with the two given stories:

* In the source story, William is motivated by the promise of gingerbread to clean his room, but ultimately fails to do so.
* In Story A, Karen is motivated by the promise of a trip to Hawaii to pass her classes, but ultimately fails to do so.
* In Story B, Karen is motivated by the promise of a trip to Hawaii to do well in her classes, but ultimately fails to do so.

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's break down the source story and the two alternative stories:

Source story:

* Mr. Newton, a manager, uses a new razor and cuts his neck severely.
* The inventor recommends a safety feature to prevent similar accidents.
* Mr. Newton agrees and starts producing the safety razor.

Story A:

* Ms. Boyce, in charge of installing heat lamps, uses a new lamp and gets seriously burned.
* The supplier recommends a warning label to prevent similar accidents.
* Ms. Boyce agrees and has the labels printed immediately.

Story B:

* Ms. Boyce, in charge of installing sun lamps, uses a new lamp and gets seriously burned.
* The supplier recommends a warning label, but Ms. Boyce initially thinks it's unnecessary.
* After the accident, Ms. Boyce has the labels printed immediately.

Now, let's identify the analogous elements:

* In the source story, Mr. Newton uses a new product (razor) and gets injured.
* In both Story A and Story B, Ms. Boyce uses a new product (heat lamp) and gets injured.
* In the source story, the inventor recommends a safety feature, and Mr. Newton agrees.
* In both Story A and Story B, the supplier recommends a safety feature (warning label), and the person in charge (Ms. Boyce) agrees.

The key difference is that in Story B, Ms. Boyce initially disagrees with the recommendation, whereas in the source story and Story A, the person in charge agrees with the recommendation immediately.

Based on this analysis, I would say that:

* He brags to his wife that he'll never be late for conferences with a chauffeur.
* However, the chauffeur is asleep, and Joseph is late for a conference.
* To avoid this, Joseph hires a second chauffeur, which becomes expensive.

* One day, Alexander is hungry and goes home, but his wife has only prepared food for herself and their baby, thinking Alexander will eat elsewhere.
* Alexander goes without dinner.
* To avoid this, Alexander marries a second wife.

* One day, Alexander is hungry and goes to his first wife, but she has only prepared food for herself and their baby, thinking Alexander will eat with his second wife.
* Alexander then goes to his second wife, but she has already finished eating, thinking Alexander is eating with his first wife.
* Alexander goes without dinner.

Now, let's identify the analogous elements:

* Both stories (A and B) feature a character (Alexander) who boasts about having a solution to a problem (eating well or being on time).

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the stories step by step.

**Common theme:** Both stories A and B have a theme of boasting and then facing the consequences of being late or going hungry.

**Similarity to the source story:** In the source story, Joseph boasts about having a chauffeur to ensure he's never late, but ends up being late due to the chauffeur's absence. Similarly, in both stories A and B, the protagonists boast about having multiple wives or a chauffeur, but ultimately face the consequences of their boasts.

**Key differences:** Story A has two wives, while the source story has a chauffeur. Story B has a single wife, but the protagonist marries a second wife to ensure he won't go hungry again.

**Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, I believe that **Story A** is analogous to the source story. Both stories feature a protagonist who boasts about having multiple resources (wives or a chauffeur) to ensure they won't face a particular problem (lateness or hunger), but ultimately face the consequences of their boasts.

Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the source story and the two given stories.

In the source story, a hunter is trying to shoot a hawk to get its feathers. The hawk, Karla, offers to give the hunter some feathers, and the hunter is so grateful that he pledges never to shoot at a hawk again.

Now, let's look at story A:

In story A, Zerdia is attacked by Gagrach, but the attack fails. Zerdia then offers to sell some of its computers to Gagrach, and Gagrach promises never to attack Zerdia again.

The analogy between the source story and story A is that in both cases, the attacker (hunter/hacker) is trying to get something from the target (hawk/computer), and the target offers to give them what they want, leading to a peaceful resolution.

In story B, Zerdia sells a supercomputer to Gagrach, but Gagrach then uses it to launch a surprise attack on Zerdia. This is not analogous to the source story, as the target (Zerdia) is not offering to give the attacker (Gagrach) what they want, but rather is being deceived.

Only one answer is correct.

","Let's analyze the source story and the two alternative stories.

In the source story, a hunter is trying to shoot a hawk to get its feathers. The hawk, Karla, offers to give the hunter some feathers, and the hunter is so grateful that he pledges never to shoot at a hawk again.

Now, let's look at story A:

In story A, Zerdia sells a supercomputer to Gagrach, and Gagrach promises not to attack Zerdia. However, Gagrach later attacks Zerdia, and it's revealed that the missiles were guided by Zerdian supercomputers. This doesn't seem analogous to the source story, as there's no offer of a ""feather"" equivalent in this story.

Now, let's look at story B:

In story B, Zerdia is attacked by Gagrach, but the attack fails because the missiles are badly aimed. Zerdia then offers to sell some of its computers to Gagrach, and Gagrach promises never to attack Zerdia again. This story seems more analogous to the source story, as Zerdia is offering something of value (computers) to Gagrach, and Gagrach is grateful and promises not to attack Zerdia again.

The source story is about Peter, a young man who moves to Florida and tries to get a tan to fit in, but ends up getting severely burned and decides to leave Florida.

Story A is about Quiggly Company, which tries to get into the integrated circuit market by building a space factory, but ends up losing money and decides to go back to making conventional electrical components.

Story B is about Quiggly Company, which also tries to get into the integrated circuit market, but decides not to build a space factory after receiving warnings from market analysts and instead goes back to making conventional electrical components.

Now, let's look for similarities between the source story and the two alternative stories.

* In the source story, Peter tries to fit in by getting a tan, but ends up getting hurt. In both Story A and Story B, Quiggly Company tries to fit in with the integrated circuit market by building a space factory, but ends up losing money.
* In the source story, Peter's decision to get a tan is driven by his desire to fit in with the locals. Similarly, in both Story A and Story B, Quiggly Company's decision to build a space factory is driven by its desire to fit in with the other manufacturers of integrated circuits.

Based on these similarities, I would say that both Story A and Story B are analogous to the source story.

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that Story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, the protagonist (Peter/Quiggly Company) tries to fit in with the crowd, but ends up getting hurt or losing money. In Story A, Quiggly Company's decision to build a space factory is more driven by a desire to be competitive, rather than a desire to fit in.

","Let's analyze the stories:

**Source story:**

* Julius finds pears, thinks they're rotten, wants to try them, but can't reach them due to being too weak.
* He becomes disappointed and goes to sleep.

**Story A:**

* Cindy finds records, thinks they're bad, wants to buy them to prove her hunch, but can't afford them.
* She becomes disappointed.

**Story B:**

* Cindy finds records, wants them, but can't afford them.
* She gets over her disappointment and thinks the records might be boring anyway.

Now, let's identify the analogous elements:

* Both stories A and B involve Cindy finding something she's interested in (records), but can't have due to being too expensive.
* In both stories, Cindy becomes disappointed, but in Story B, she gets over her disappointment and finds a way to rationalize not wanting the records.

The key difference is that in Story A, Cindy's disappointment is due to her initial expectation that the records are bad, while in Story B, her disappointment is due to not being able to afford the records.

The analogous story to the source story is **Story A**, as both involve a character finding something they're interested in, but can't have due to a limitation (Julius can't reach the pears, Cindy can't afford the records), leading to disappointment.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Source story:

* A dog named Leonard loses a steak and then tries to take another dog's steak, but ends up losing a tooth.
* The key elements are: losing something (steak), trying to take something else, and ending up worse off.

Story A:

* Charlie loses an expensive pocket watch and then tries to take another man's watch, but ends up getting caught by a policeman.
* The key elements are: losing something (watch), trying to take something else, and ending up in a bad situation.

Story B:

* Charlie sees his own reflection and tries to take his own watch, but ends up breaking both watches and losing his own.
* The key elements are: losing something (watch), trying to take something else (but it's actually the same thing), and ending up worse off.

Comparing the three stories, we can see that Story A is the most analogous to the source story. Both stories involve losing something, trying to take something else, and ending up in a bad situation. The only difference is that Story A involves a different object (watch vs. steak) and a different outcome (getting caught by a policeman vs. losing a tooth).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> A </ans>",,A,A

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the source story and the two given stories.

The source story is about a dog named Leonard who loses his steak and then tries to take another dog's steak, but ends up losing a tooth.

Story A is about Charlie who drops his own watch and then tries to take another man's watch, but ends up with no watch.

Story B is about Charlie who drops his own watch and then sees another man with an expensive watch, but doesn't try to take it.

The key elements that make the source story analogous to another story are:

1. Losing something valuable (steak/watch)
2. Trying to take something else to replace what was lost
3. Ending up with less or nothing as a result

Story A matches these elements, as Charlie loses his watch, tries to take another man's watch, and ends up with no watch.

Story B does not match these elements, as Charlie does not try to take the other man's watch.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> A </ans>",,A,B

In the source story, Boris and Ivan are business partners who have a disagreement due to Ivan's absent-mindedness, which leads to a loss of money. However, Ivan redeems himself by selling his stereo set to replace the lost cash.

In story A, John and Christine are getting married, and Christine accidentally dents John's new car. John is upset and insists that Christine never drive his car again.

In story B, John and Christine are getting married, and John discovers that Christine is a reckless driver. John insists that Christine never drive his new car, which upsets Christine so much that she dents John's new car.

Now, let's look for similarities between the source story and the two given stories.

* In the source story, there is a disagreement between business partners due to Ivan's absent-mindedness.
* In story A, there is no disagreement between John and Christine due to Christine's reckless behavior. Instead, John is upset and insists that Christine never drive his car again.
* In story B, there is a disagreement between John and Christine due to John's discovery of Christine's reckless driving behavior. However, the motivation for Christine's actions is different from the source story. In the source story, Ivan redeems himself by selling his stereo set to replace the lost cash, whereas in story B, Christine dents John's car out of spite.

Based on these similarities and differences, I would say that story B is analogous to the source story.

Comparing the stories, we can see that story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, there is a disagreement between partners (Boris and Ivan, John and Christine) due to a mistake or absent-mindedness (Ivan throwing away cash, Christine denting the car). In both stories, the mistake is rectified (Ivan selling his stereo set, Christine not intentionally causing damage), and the partner who made the mistake is restricted from handling certain matters (Ivan with monetary matters, Christine with John's car).

Which story is analogous to the source story?

In the source story, Bolon takes over Salam, and then proposes a treaty with Mayonia, which ultimately leads to Mayonia taking over both countries. In both story options, Moreland (or Bolon) makes a deal with Chad (or Mayonia) that ultimately leads to both Lincoln (or Salam) and Moreland (or Bolon) being taken advantage of.

The key similarity is that in both the source story and Story A, Moreland (or Bolon) tries to make a deal with the more powerful entity (Chad or Mayonia) to protect themselves, but ultimately ends up being taken over. This is not the case in Story B, where Moreland overpowers Lincoln and then tries to make a deal with Chad, which is a different sequence of events.

**Source story:**

* A farmer, Beedle, has a special apricot tree that he values and gives presents to everyone he knows.
* The tree withers and loses its fruit, making everyone unhappy.
* A judge takes the tree to his own garden, pays Beedle well, and the tree starts bearing delicious apricots again, winning a prize at the county fair.

**Story A:**

* Mr. Gerson has a canary that he values and occasionally invites friends to hear it sing.
* The canary becomes ill and stops singing, making everyone disappointed.
* A veterinarian friend buys the canary, pays Mr. Gerson well, and the canary starts singing again.

**Story B:**

* Mr. Gerson has a canary that he values and occasionally invites friends to hear it sing.
* A wealthy businessman buys the canary, pays Mr. Gerson well, and moves it to his city house.
* However, the canary becomes fatally ill and stops singing, making everyone disappointed.

Now, let's identify the analogous elements:

* In the source story and Story A, the special tree/canary is taken away by someone who values it and takes care of it, leading to its recovery.
* In both stories, the person who takes the tree/canary away is willing to pay well for it.

In contrast, Story B does not have a happy ending for the canary, and the businessman's motivations are different (he wants to keep the canary in his city house, not necessarily to care for it).

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the stories step by step.

**Common elements:**

* Both stories A and B have a character named Mr. Gerson who values a canary above all his other pets.
* Both stories have a character who wants to take the canary away from Mr. Gerson.

**Differences:**

* In story A, the canary becomes fatally ill after being moved, while in story B, the canary recovers after being moved.
* In story A, the character who takes the canary away is a wealthy businessman, while in story B, the character is a veterinarian friend.

**Comparison to the source story:**

* In the source story, the judge takes the apricot tree away from Beedle and it recovers after being transplanted.
* In both stories A and B, the character who takes the canary away is motivated by a desire to enjoy the canary's songs, just like the judge in the source story.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, I conclude that **story B** is analogous to the source story. In both stories, the canary is taken away by a character who wants to care for it, and it recovers after being moved. In contrast, story A has a different outcome, where the canary becomes fatally ill after being moved.

A little girl named Jenny loved to play with her dog in her neighbor's yard. Eventually, the neighbor got fed-up and told her she should always play with her dog in her own yard. 
 A few days later, Jenny snuck out of the house without doing her chores and hid at the playground. But after awhile she went home to play with her dog because she thought her neighbor said she should every day. Right away her mother caught her and the little girl wished she hadn't listened to her neighbor.

This is story B:

A little girl named Jenny wished she could run away from home. She loved to play with her dog every day, but only in her neighbor's yard. Eventually, her neighbor got fed-up and told her to always play in her own yard.
 But Jenny refused to listen because she thought it was bad luck to play in her own yard. The last time she did it her mother caught her right away and made her go to work.

","Let's analyze the stories:

**Source story**: Morris, a simple-minded prisoner, is told by his cellmate to play the harmonica during the day. He escapes and hides in a boxcar, but then starts playing the harmonica again because he remembers his cellmate's advice. He gets caught by the cops.

**Story A**: Jenny, a little girl, is told by her neighbor to play with her dog in her own yard. She sneaks out to play with her dog in the neighbor's yard, but then goes home to play with her dog again because she thinks her neighbor said she should play every day. She gets caught by her mother.

**Story B**: Jenny, a little girl, is told by her neighbor to play in her own yard. She refuses to listen because she thinks it's bad luck to play in her own yard. The story doesn't mention her playing in the neighbor's yard or getting caught.

Comparing the stories, we can see that:

* Both stories A and the source story feature a character being told to do something (play harmonica or play with dog) and then doing it again because they remember the advice.
* Both stories A and the source story feature the character getting caught or punished for their actions.

Therefore, the analogous story is:

","Let's analyze the stories step by step.

In the source story, Morris's cellmate tells him to play the harmonica during the day, and Morris follows this advice, which leads to his capture. Then, Morris decides to cover the walls with obscenities in his cell.

In story A, Jenny's neighbor tells her to play with her dog in her own yard, and Jenny refuses to listen because she thinks it's bad luck. This leads to her getting caught by her mother.

In story B, Jenny's neighbor tells her to play with her dog in her own yard, and Jenny listens to this advice. She then sneaks out of the house to play with her dog at the playground, but gets caught by her mother.

Comparing the stories, we can see that:

* In both stories A and B, the neighbor/authority figure gives advice to Jenny, and Jenny follows this advice.
* In both stories, Jenny's decision to follow the advice leads to her getting caught by her mother.

The key similarity between the source story and story B is that Morris and Jenny both follow the advice given to them, which leads to their capture. In story A, Jenny refuses to listen to the advice, which is not analogous to the source story.

Source story:

* King Otto is obsessed with conquest and riches, but his counselor advises him to balance his military and domestic expenditures.
* King Otto ignores the advice and focuses on conquest, but ultimately, his own mistake (crashing through an unfinished bridge) makes him realize the importance of balancing his expenditures.

Story A:

* Cornelius is obsessed with astronomy, but his wife Agatha advises him to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.
* Cornelius ignores the advice and focuses on astronomy, but ultimately, his own mistake (an unfinished floor collapsing) makes him realize the importance of balancing his time.

Story B:

* Cornelius is obsessed with astronomy, and his wife Agatha advises him to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.
* Cornelius ignores the advice and focuses on astronomy, and the house becomes unlivable due to neglect.
* Eventually, Cornelius is injured when a rotten floor collapses, and he realizes that Agatha was right all along.

Comparing the three stories, we can see that both Story A and Story B have a similar structure and theme to the source story. Both Cornelius and King Otto are obsessed with something and ignore advice to balance their priorities, leading to their own mistakes and eventual realization of the importance of balance.

However, Story B has a more significant difference in that the house becomes unlivable due to Cornelius's neglect, whereas in the source story, King Otto's mistake is more of an accident. This difference makes Story B less analogous to the source story.

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's break down the source story and the two alternative stories:

Source story:

* Mark, a chicken farmer, is collecting eggs when his chickens suddenly attack him for no apparent reason.
* The chickens chase him out of the henhouse and into the woods.
* A thief takes advantage of the situation and steals the eggs.
* Mark quits chicken farming and goes on a vacation.

Story A:

* Linda, a camp director, is thinking about the camp while the girls are away.
* The girls return and start pestering her with questions.
* Linda gets frustrated and runs away, and the girls follow her.
* A tidal wave hits the beach and washes away the sleeping bags.

Story B:

* A tidal wave hits the beach and washes away the sleeping bags.
* Linda, the camp director, returns and finds the sleeping bags gone.
* The girls return from hiking and attack Linda because they can't find their sleeping bags.
* Linda gets frustrated and runs away.

Now, let's look for similarities between the source story and the two alternative stories:

* In the source story, Mark is attacked by his chickens, and in both Story A and Story B, Linda is attacked by the girl scouts.
* In the source story, Mark is chased out of the henhouse and into the woods, and in both Story A and Story B, Linda is chased away by the girl scouts.
* In the source story, a thief takes advantage of the situation and steals the eggs, and in both Story A and Story B, a disaster (the tidal wave) occurs while Linda is away, and she returns to find chaos.

Based on these similarities, I would say that:

In the source story, two pioneers, Smith and Johnson, discover a valley and fight over who saw it first. Sheriff Jones intervenes and divides the land evenly between them. In the end, they become friends and help each other.

In story A, Betty and Norma discover a twenty-dollar bill and argue over who saw it first. Their teacher, Mrs. Lee, intervenes and divides the money between them. They then realize they should have done it themselves.

In story B, Betty and Norma discover a twenty-dollar bill and argue over who saw it first. Lee (no title mentioned) takes the money herself, and by the time Betty and Norma realize they should divide it, it's too late.

Now, let's compare the stories:

* In the source story and story A, a third party intervenes and divides the disputed item (land/money) between the two parties.
* In the source story and story A, the two parties eventually become friends or realize they should have divided it themselves.

Story B does not have these elements. Lee takes the money herself, and the story does not show the two parties becoming friends or realizing they should have divided it themselves.

**Story A:**

* Betty and Norma discover a twenty-dollar bill and argue over who saw it first.
* Lee takes the money while they're arguing.
* Betty and Norma realize they should have divided it themselves, but it's too late.

**Story B:**

* Mrs. Lee, their teacher, takes the money and divides it between them.
* Betty and Norma realize they should have divided it themselves.

Now, let's identify the analogous elements:

* In both stories A and B, a third party (Lee, Mrs. Lee) intervenes and divides the valuable thing between the two individuals.
* In all three stories, the individuals involved realize that they should have divided the valuable thing themselves, but it's too late (or they learn to do so in the end).
