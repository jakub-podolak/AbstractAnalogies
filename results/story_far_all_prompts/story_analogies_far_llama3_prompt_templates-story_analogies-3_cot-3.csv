Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the reference story (Ref) and the two other stories (A/B).

In the reference story (Ref), William is a patient in a psychiatric hospital who is confined indoors and spends most of his time daydreaming about food. He is motivated by the promise of gingerbread from the cookie shop, but ultimately fails to pass the inspection and does not receive the gingerbread.

Now, let's look at the two other stories (A/B).

Story A: Karen is a student who always did poorly in high school and spends most of her time daydreaming about going to Hawaii. She is motivated by the promise of a trip to Hawaii, but ultimately fails to pass enough classes to graduate and does not go to Hawaii.

Story B: Karen is also a student who dislikes high school and spends most of her time daydreaming about Hawaii. She is motivated by the promise of a trip to Hawaii, and during the last few weeks of school, she spends most of her time dreaming about Hawaii and preparing for her trip. However, she fails to graduate and does not get to go to Hawaii.

Comparing the three stories, I notice that both Story A and Story B have a similar structure and plot to the reference story (Ref). In all three stories, the main character is motivated by a promise of something they desire (gingerbread, trip to Hawaii), but ultimately fails to achieve their goal due to their own lack of effort or procrastination.

However, there is one key difference between Story A and Story B. In Story A, Karen is motivated by the promise of a trip to Hawaii, but she fails to pass enough classes to graduate and does not go to Hawaii. In Story B, Karen is also motivated by the promise of a trip to Hawaii, but she spends most of her time preparing for the trip and dreaming about it, and ultimately fails to graduate.

Based on this analysis, I believe that Story A is the most analogous to the reference story (Ref). Both stories feature a main character who is motivated by a promise of something they desire, but ultimately fails to achieve their goal due to their own lack of effort or procrastination.

Therefore, my final answer is:

<ans> A </ans>",,A,A

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the reference story (Ref) and the two other stories (A and B).

In the reference story (Ref), William is a patient in a psychiatric hospital who is confined indoors and has a hard time keeping his room clean. He is motivated by the promise of gingerbread to clean his room, but he fails to do so and doesn't get the gingerbread.

Now, let's look at story A. Karen in story A is also motivated by a promise (a trip to Hawaii) to do well in her classes, but she fails to do so and doesn't get to go to Hawaii. This is similar to William's situation in the reference story, where he is motivated by the promise of gingerbread to clean his room, but fails to do so and doesn't get the gingerbread.

On the other hand, story B is different. Karen in story B is not motivated by a promise to do well in her classes, but rather by the promise of a trip to Hawaii if she does well enough. This is not similar to William's situation in the reference story, where he is motivated by a promise of gingerbread to clean his room.

Therefore, I conclude that story A is analogous to the reference story.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the stories step by step.

First, let's identify the key elements in the reference story (Ref):

* Mr. Newton is the manager of a company that makes razors.
* An inventor perfects a new metal that stays sharper than previous razors.
* Mr. Newton uses one of these new razors and cuts his neck severely.
* The inventor recommends a safety feature to prevent similar accidents.
* Mr. Newton considers the safety feature necessary and begins producing it immediately.

Now, let's compare these elements to Story A:

* Ms. Boyce is in charge of installing heat lamps sold by the Smith Tan Company.
* A supplier perfects a new filament that produces more intense heat.
* Ms. Boyce uses one of these new heat lamps and is seriously burned.
* The supplier recommends a warning label to prevent similar accidents.
* Ms. Boyce considers the labels necessary and has them printed immediately.

The key elements in Story A match the reference story quite well. The only difference is the type of product (razors vs. heat lamps) and the character's name. However, the sequence of events and the reactions of the characters are very similar.

On the other hand, Story B has some significant differences:

* The character's name is the same, but the product is different (sun lamps instead of heat lamps).
* The supplier recommends a warning label from the start, whereas in the reference story and Story A, the recommendation comes after the accident.
* Ms. Boyce initially considers the labels unnecessary in Story B, which is not the case in the reference story and Story A.

Based on these comparisons, I believe that Story A is the most analogous to the reference story. Therefore, my answer is:

<ans> A </ans>",,A,A

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the stories step by step.

The reference story (Ref) is about Mr. Newton, who is the manager of a company that makes razors. An inventor in his company creates a new metal that stays sharper than before, but Mr. Newton accidentally cuts his neck while using one of these new razors. As a result, the inventor recommends a safety feature, and Mr. Newton decides to produce the safety razor immediately.

Now, let's look at Story A:

* Ms. Boyce is in charge of installing sun lamps sold by Smith Tan Company.
* A supplier perfects a new filament that produces more intense heat.
* Ms. Boyce considers the warning labels unnecessary, but later, she is seriously burned while using one of these new heat lamps.
* After the accident, she is frightened and has the warning labels printed immediately.

And let's look at Story B:

* Ms. Boyce is in charge of installing heat lamps sold by the Smith Tan Company.
* A supplier perfects a new filament that produces more intense heat.
* Ms. Boyce is seriously burned while using one of these new heat lamps.
* Because of the accident, the supplier recommends a warning label, and Ms. Boyce considers the labels absolutely necessary. She has them printed immediately.

Comparing the stories, we can see that both stories have similar elements:

* A manager (Ms. Boyce) is in charge of installing lamps.
* A supplier perfects a new technology (filament).
* The manager is accidentally injured while using the new technology.
* The accident leads to the recommendation of a safety feature (warning label).
* The manager decides to implement the safety feature after the accident.

However, there is one key difference between the stories: in Story A, Ms. Boyce is the one who is injured, while in Story B, the supplier is the one who recommends the warning label.

Given this analysis, I believe that Story A is analogous to the reference story (Ref).",<ans> A </ans>,A,B

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the stories.

**Ref**: Joseph hires a chauffeur to drive his Rolls-Royce, but the chauffeur sleeps in, and Joseph is late for a conference. To avoid this, Joseph hires a second chauffeur, which becomes expensive.

**Story A**: Alexander boasts to a friend that he'll always eat well with his wife at home. However, his wife thinks he'll eat elsewhere and only prepares for herself and the baby. Alexander goes hungry. To avoid this, Alexander marries a second wife.

**Story B**: Alexander has two wives living in two houses and boasts that he'll always eat well with both. However, his first wife only prepares for herself and the baby, and his second wife thinks he's eating with the other wife. Alexander goes hungry.

Now, let's look for similarities between the reference story and the other two stories.

* Both stories A and B involve a character (Alexander/Joseph) who boasts about having a solution to a problem (eating well/being on time).
* Both stories A and B involve a character who is disappointed or goes without what they want (Alexander goes hungry, Joseph is late).
* Both stories A and B involve a character who tries to solve the problem by adding something new (Alexander marries a second wife, Joseph hires a second chauffeur).

However, there's a key difference between the stories. In the reference story, Joseph's problem is caused by the chauffeur's laziness, whereas in the other two stories, Alexander's problem is caused by his wives' misunderstandings.

Based on this analysis, I think **Story A** is analogous to the reference story.",<ans> A </ans>,A,A

**Story B**: Alexander lives with his wife and likes to boast that he'll always eat well with her at home. When he's hungry, he finds that his wife has only prepared for herself and the baby, so he goes without dinner. To avoid this, Alexander marries a second wife.

Now, let's look for similarities between the reference story and the other two stories.

* In all three stories, the main character (Joseph/Alexander) is hungry and wants to eat.
* In all three stories, the main character's expectations are not met, and they go without food.
* In both **Story A** and **Ref**, the main character hires someone (chauffeur/wife) to help them, but this solution doesn't work out.

However, there's a key difference between **Story A** and **Ref**: in **Story A**, Alexander has two wives, but in **Ref**, Joseph hires a chauffeur. This suggests that the analogous story might be the one that also involves hiring someone to help.

**Story B** is more similar to **Ref** in this regard, as Alexander marries a second wife to avoid going hungry again, similar to how Joseph hires a second chauffeur.

Ref: Karla, an old hawk, lived at the top of a tall oak tree. One afternoon, she saw a hunter on the ground with a bow and some crude arrows that had no feathers. The hunter took aim and shot at the hawk but missed. Karla knew the hunter wanted her feathers so she glided down to the hunter and offered to give him a few. The hunter was so grateful that he pledged never to shoot at a hawk again. He went off and shot deer instead.

Story A: Once there was a small country called Zerdia that learned to make the world's smartest computer. One day Zerdia was attacked by its warlike neighbor, Gagrach. But the missiles were badly aimed and the attack failed. The Zerdian government realized that Gagrach wanted Zerdian computers so it offered to sell some of its computers to the country. The government of Gagrach was very pleased. It promised never to attack Zerdia again.

Story B: Once there was a small country called Zerdia that learned to make the world's smartest computer. Zerdia sold one of itssupercomputers to its neighbor, Gagrach, so Gagrach would promise never to attack Zerdia. But one day Zerdia was overwhelmed by a surprise attack from Gagrach. As it capitulated the crippled government of Zerdia realized that the attacker's missiles had been guided by Zerdian supercomputers.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the reference story (Ref) and the two other stories (A/B).

In the reference story (Ref), Karla, an old hawk, is threatened by a hunter who wants her feathers. Karla offers to give the hunter some feathers, and the hunter agrees to never shoot at a hawk again.

Now, let's look at Story A:

* Zerdia, a small country, is attacked by its warlike neighbor, Gagrach.
* The attack fails, and Zerdia offers to sell some of its computers to Gagrach.
* Gagrach promises never to attack Zerdia again.

In this story, Zerdia is offering something of value (computers) to Gagrach in exchange for a promise of non-aggression. This is similar to Karla offering her feathers to the hunter in the reference story.

Now, let's look at Story B:

* Zerdia sells one of its supercomputers to Gagrach, and Gagrach promises never to attack Zerdia.
* However, Zerdia is later attacked by Gagrach, and it is revealed that the attacker's missiles were guided by Zerdian supercomputers.

In this story, Zerdia is not offering something of value to Gagrach in exchange for a promise of non-aggression. Instead, Zerdia is simply selling its technology to Gagrach, and Gagrach is using it to attack Zerdia.

Based on this analysis, I believe that Story A is analogous to the reference story (Ref).",<ans> A </ans>,A,A

In the reference story (Ref), Karla, an old hawk, is threatened by a hunter who wants her feathers. Karla offers to give the hunter some feathers, and the hunter agrees to never shoot at a hawk again.

Now, let's look at Story A:

* Zerdia sells a supercomputer to Gagrach, and Gagrach promises not to attack Zerdia.
* However, Gagrach attacks Zerdia, and the attack is successful.

This story doesn't seem to match the pattern of the reference story. The hunter in the reference story is deterred from attacking Karla by her offer of feathers, but in Story A, Gagrach is not deterred from attacking Zerdia despite receiving the supercomputer.

Let's look at Story B:

* Zerdia is attacked by Gagrach, but the attack fails because the missiles are badly aimed.
* Zerdia offers to sell some of its computers to Gagrach, and Gagrach promises never to attack Zerdia again.

This story seems to match the pattern of the reference story. Just like the hunter in the reference story is deterred from attacking Karla by her offer of feathers, Gagrach is deterred from attacking Zerdia by Zerdia's offer of computers.

Therefore, I conclude that Story B is analogous to the reference story.

In the reference story (Ref), Peter is a young man who moves to Florida and tries to get a tan to fit in with the locals, but ends up getting second-degree burns and decides to leave Florida.

In Story A, Quiggly Company is a small company that tries to get into the integrated circuit market by building a space factory, but ends up spending too much money and losing everything.

In Story B, Quiggly Company is a small company that starts producing integrated circuits and is warned by market analysts that space manufacturing is too expensive and competitive. Quiggly Company decides to stick with conventional electrical components.

The key similarity between the reference story (Ref) and Story A is that both involve a character (Peter/Quiggly Company) trying to fit in or be competitive by taking a risk, but ultimately ending up in a bad situation.

The key difference between the reference story (Ref) and Story B is that Story B involves a character being warned about the risks and deciding to play it safe, whereas the reference story (Ref) does not involve any warnings or caution.

","Let's analyze the reference story (Ref) and the two other stories (A and B).

In the reference story (Ref), Julius is a mule who wants to eat the pears but is unable to due to their height and his own weakness. He becomes disappointed and goes to sleep, dreaming about mountains of pears.

Now, let's look at story A:

* Cindy finds records she wants, but they're too expensive.
* She becomes disappointed, but then rationalizes that the records might be boring anyway, so it's not a big loss.
* She doesn't actually try to buy the records or investigate their quality.

In story B:

* Cindy finds records she's curious about, but they look bad to her.
* She thinks she'll buy them to test her hunch, but they're too expensive.
* She becomes disappointed because she can't afford them.

Comparing the two stories, I notice that story B is more similar to the reference story (Ref) in terms of the protagonist's thought process and emotional response. Both Julius and Cindy:

* Want something (pears/records) but are unable to get it due to external circumstances (height/expensiveness).
* Experience disappointment.
* Have a thought process that tries to rationalize or make sense of their situation (Julius dreams about mountains of pears, Cindy thinks the records might be boring).

Story A, on the other hand, has a different emotional response and thought process. Cindy becomes disappointed, but then quickly moves on and doesn't dwell on it. She doesn't have the same level of attachment or emotional investment in the records as Julius does with the pears.

Based on these similarities, I'm going to choose:

Story B, on the other hand, is different from the reference story (Ref) in that Sam's mother is not disappointed by the gift itself, but rather by Sam's behavior (wasting his time). The gift is given after the mother's initial rejection, rather than as an attempt to get something in return.

In Story A, Sam travels the world buying things, runs out of money, and visits his mother.

In Story B, the situation is similar to Story A, with Sam giving his mother a gift and hoping for a loan, but she's not pleased and rejects him. However, the tone of the story is slightly different, as the mother specifically calls the gift ""a piece of junk"", which adds a new layer of disappointment to the story.

Based on the analysis, I think Story A is more analogous to the reference story (Ref). Both stories feature a character trying to get something from someone else in exchange for a gift, but the other person is disappointed and rejects them. The tone of the stories is similar, with a sense of disappointment and rejection.

Therefore, my final answer is:

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the reference story (Ref) and the two other stories (A/B).

In the reference story (Ref), a dog named Leonard loses a steak and then tries to take another dog's steak, but ends up losing a tooth in the process.

In Story A, Charlie loses a pocket watch and then tries to take another man's watch, but ends up facing a policeman.

In Story B, Charlie sees another man with an expensive watch and, thinking it's the other man's watch, tries to take it. However, it's actually his own reflection, and he ends up dropping his own watch and shattering both watches on the floor.

Comparing the three stories, I notice that Story B is the only one where the protagonist (Charlie) is trying to take something that belongs to someone else (his reflection), which is a key element in the reference story (Ref). In Story A, Charlie is trying to take another man's watch, but it's not his reflection. In the reference story (Ref), Leonard is trying to take another dog's steak, but it's not his reflection either.

Therefore, I conclude that Story B is the most analogous to the reference story (Ref).

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the reference story (Ref) and the two other stories (A/B).

In the reference story (Ref), Boris and Ivan are business partners, and Ivan's absent-mindedness leads to a problem (throwing out cash). Boris is upset and demands that Ivan not be involved in monetary matters. However, Ivan redeems himself by selling his stereo set to replace the lost cash.

Now, let's look at Story A:

* John and Christine are getting married, and Christine is reckless.
* Christine accidentally dents John's new car, which upsets John.
* John insists that Christine never drive his car again.

The similarity between Story A and the reference story (Ref) is that both involve a partner's mistake causing a problem, and the other partner reacts by taking away a responsibility or privilege. However, the story is not identical, as Christine's recklessness is not the same as Ivan's absent-mindedness.

Now, let's look at Story B:

* John and Christine are getting married, and John discovers that Christine is a reckless driver.
* John insists that Christine never drive his new car, which upsets Christine.
* Christine dents John's new car in retaliation.

The similarity between Story B and the reference story (Ref) is that both involve a partner's mistake causing a problem, and the other partner reacts by taking away a responsibility or privilege. Additionally, the story involves a retaliatory action (Christine denting the car) similar to Ivan selling his stereo set to replace the lost cash.

Based on these similarities, I believe that Story B is the most analogous to the reference story (Ref). Therefore, my answer is:

This is similar to the pattern in the reference story (Ref), where Ivan's absent-mindedness leads to a problem, and Boris's reaction is to restrict Ivan's involvement in monetary matters.

In contrast, Story B is more focused on the accident (denting the car) and John's reaction to it, rather than the underlying issue of Christine's recklessness. While it shares some similarities with the reference story (Ref), it doesn't capture the same dynamic between the characters.

In the reference story, Bolon takes over Salam, and then proposes a treaty with Mayonia. In both Story A and Story B, Moreland takes action to ""make the best of the situation"" by offering to help Chad rob Lincoln (Story A) or overpowering Lincoln (Story B).

In the reference story, Bolon is unable to stop Mayonia from taking over both countries. Similarly, in both Story A and Story B, Moreland is unable to prevent Chad from robbing both Lincoln and himself.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the stories step by step.

First, let's identify the common elements between the reference story and the two other stories:

* A person (Beedle/Mr. Gerson) values a specific item (apricot tree/canary) above all others.
* The item becomes unavailable or loses its special quality (withers/no more songs).
* A third party (judge/veterinarian/businessman) takes an interest in the item and decides to acquire it.
* The item is moved to a new location (judge's garden/veterinarian's office/businessman's house).
* The item regains its special quality (bears delicious apricots/sings beautiful songs) in its new location.

Now, let's compare the two other stories to the reference story:

Story A: This story matches the common elements closely. The veterinarian friend takes an interest in the canary, acquires it, and moves it to his office, where it regains its singing ability. This story is analogous to the reference story.

Story B: This story also matches the common elements, but with a twist. The businessman acquires the canary and moves it to his house, but the canary becomes fatally ill and loses its singing ability. This story does not follow the same pattern as the reference story, where the item regains its special quality in its new location.

Story A: Mr. Gerson had several pets but he valued the canary above all the rest. Occasionally, he invited friends over to hear the canary sing.
 A wealthy businessman liked the canary's songs so much that one autumn he decided he wanted the bird in his house in the city where he could enjoy it every day. He paid Mr. Gerson very well and had the canary moved to his house.
 However, upon being moved the canary became fatally ill and there were no more of its beautiful songs. Everyone was extremely disappointed.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the stories step by step.

First, let's identify the key elements in the reference story (Ref):

* A valued object (the choice apricot tree)
* The object's value is appreciated by others (the judge)
* The object's value is taken away from the original owner (Beedle)
* The object is moved to a new location
* The object's value is restored, and it flourishes in the new location

Now, let's compare these elements to Story A:

* A valued object (the canary)
* The object's value is appreciated by others (the wealthy businessman)
* The object's value is taken away from the original owner (Mr. Gerson)
* The object is moved to a new location
* The object's value is not restored, and it becomes fatally ill

Story A does not match the key elements of the reference story. The canary's value is not restored, and it does not flourish in the new location.

Now, let's compare these elements to Story B:

* A valued object (the canary)
* The object's value is appreciated by others (the veterinarian friend)
* The object's value is taken away from the original owner (Mr. Gerson)
* The object is moved to a new location
* The object's value is restored, and it flourishes in the new location

Story B matches the key elements of the reference story. The canary's value is restored, and it sings beautiful songs again in the new location.

Therefore, the analogous story is:

","Let's analyze the stories.

The reference story (Ref) is about Morris, a simple-minded prisoner who escapes from prison and gets caught again because he follows his cellmate's advice to play the harmonica every day. Morris's mistake is that he takes his cellmate's advice too literally and doesn't think about the consequences.

Now, let's look at the other two stories.

Story A: Jenny, a little girl, is told by her neighbor to play with her dog in her own yard instead of her neighbor's yard. Jenny sneaks out of the house and gets caught by her mother because she thinks her neighbor said she should play with her dog every day. This story has a similar theme to the reference story, where Jenny takes her neighbor's advice too literally and gets into trouble.

Story B: Jenny, a little girl, is told by her neighbor to play with her dog in her own yard instead of her neighbor's yard. However, Jenny refuses to listen because she thinks it's bad luck to play in her own yard. This story doesn't have the same theme as the reference story, where Jenny doesn't take her neighbor's advice literally and instead makes a different decision.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the stories.

The reference story (Ref) is about Morris, a simple-minded prisoner who escapes from prison and gets caught again because he follows his cellmate's advice to play the harmonica every day. Morris's mistake is that he takes his cellmate's advice literally and without questioning its logic.

Now, let's look at the other two stories.

Story A: Jenny, a little girl, wants to play with her dog in her neighbor's yard. Her neighbor tells her to play in her own yard, but Jenny refuses to listen because she thinks it's bad luck to play in her own yard. Later, Jenny gets caught by her mother for not doing her chores.

Story B: Jenny, a little girl, loves to play with her dog in her neighbor's yard. Her neighbor tells her to play with her dog in her own yard. Later, Jenny gets caught by her mother for sneaking out of the house without doing her chores.

Comparing the two stories, I notice that both stories have a similar structure:

1. A character (Jenny) is told to do something by someone else (the neighbor).
2. The character refuses to listen or takes the advice literally.
3. The character gets caught or punished for their actions.

The key difference between the two stories is the reason why Jenny gets caught. In Story A, Jenny gets caught because she thinks it's bad luck to play in her own yard, while in Story B, Jenny gets caught for sneaking out of the house without doing her chores.

However, the similarity between the two stories lies in the fact that Jenny takes the neighbor's advice literally and without questioning its logic, just like Morris in the reference story.

Therefore, I conclude that Story B is analogous to the reference story (Ref).

","Let's analyze the stories step by step.

The reference story (Ref) is about King Otto, who is a warmonger and decides to rebuild all the bridges in his kingdom. However, his counselor, the chamberlain, complains that he is spending too much money on the bridges and not enough on actual military campaigns. King Otto then decides to abandon the bridge project and mount a full-scale invasion of a neighboring country. Later, his carriage crashes through an unfinished bridge, and he is severely injured. This accident makes him realize the importance of balancing his military and domestic expenditures.

Now, let's look at Story A:

* Cornelius is an astronomer who is obsessed with stars and galaxies.
* He is renovating his home into an observatory.
* His wife Agatha complains that he is spending too much time on the renovation and not enough on his job.
* Cornelius decides to go back to thinking about nothing but astronomy.
* Later, an unfinished floor collapses under his weight, and he is severely injured. This accident shows him that he should try to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.

Story A seems to be analogous to the reference story (Ref). Both stories have a character who is obsessed with something (King Otto with conquest and riches, Cornelius with astronomy) and is advised to balance their priorities. Both stories also feature an accident that makes the character realize the importance of balancing their priorities.

Let's look at Story B:

* Cornelius is an astronomer who is obsessed with stars and galaxies.
* His wife Agatha complains that he is spending too much time on astronomy and not enough on maintaining his own house.
* The house is becoming unlivable due to the neglect.
* Cornelius refuses to listen to Agatha's complaints.
* Later, a rotten floor collapses under his weight, and he is severely injured. This accident shows him that Agatha was right all along, and he decides to try to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.

Story B is similar to the reference story (Ref) in that it also features a character who is obsessed with something and is advised to balance their priorities. However, the tone and plot of Story B are different from those of the reference story (Ref). In Story B, Cornelius is not initially willing to listen to his wife's complaints, whereas in the reference story (Ref), King Otto is willing to listen to his counselor's advice. Additionally, the accident in Story B is not a direct result of Cornelius's refusal to listen to his wife's advice, whereas the accident in the reference story (Ref) is a direct result of King Otto's decision to abandon the bridge project.

Based on this analysis, I believe that Story A is analogous to the reference story (Ref). Therefore, my final answer is:

","Let's analyze the stories step by step.

The reference story (Ref) is about King Otto, who is a warmonger and decides to rebuild all the bridges in his kingdom. He abandons the project to mount a full-scale invasion of a neighboring country, but then his carriage crashes through an unfinished bridge, injuring him. This incident makes him realize the importance of balancing his military and domestic expenditures.

Now, let's look at Story A:

* Cornelius is an astronomer who is obsessed with stars and galaxies.
* His wife Agatha complains that he is spending too much time on astronomy and not enough on maintaining his own house.
* The house becomes unlivable due to the neglect.
* Cornelius is injured when a rotten floor collapses under his weight, but this incident shows him that Agatha was right, and he decides to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.

Story A seems to be analogous to the reference story (Ref). Both stories feature a character who is obsessed with something (war and conquest in Ref, astronomy in A) and neglects something else (domestic expenditures in Ref, house maintenance in A). Both stories also feature an accident that makes the character realize the importance of balancing their priorities.

Let's look at Story B:

* Cornelius is an astronomer who is obsessed with stars and galaxies.
* He is gradually turning his home into an observatory.
* His wife Agatha complains that he is spending too much time renovating the house and not enough on his job (astronomy).
* The house becomes unlivable due to the renovation.
* Cornelius decides that Agatha is right and goes back to thinking about nothing but astronomy.
* An unfinished floor collapses under his weight, injuring him, but this incident does not seem to have a significant impact on his priorities.

Story B does not seem to be analogous to the reference story (Ref). While both stories feature a character who is obsessed with something and neglects something else, the accident in Story B does not seem to have the same impact on Cornelius's priorities as the accident in Story A.

","Let's analyze the stories step by step.

**Common elements:**

* Both Ref and A/B stories feature a protagonist (Frederick/Zebediah) who is scared and tries to scare away a predator/thief (lion/beggar).
* Both stories involve the protagonist giving something to the predator/thief to distract them (lamb/bag of coins).
* Both stories have the protagonist escaping and then realizing that something is missing (lamb/another bag of coins).

**Differences:**

* Ref story: Frederick gives the lion a lamb to distract it, and then takes a nap. When he wakes up, he notices another lamb is missing.
* A story: Zebediah throws a bag of coins to the beggar to distract him, and then takes the last few bags of money into the house. When he wakes up, he notices another bag of coins is missing.
* B story: Zebediah throws a second bag of coins to the beggar to distract him, and then takes the last few bags of money into the house. There is no mention of anything missing.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, I believe that **Story A** is analogous to the reference story (Ref). Both stories have a similar structure and plot, with the protagonist giving something to the predator/thief to distract them and then escaping. The only difference is the specific details of what is given and what happens afterwards.

Ref: Frederick the shepherd was tending his flock at the edge of a forest. Suddenly, a lion appeared out of the forest. Frederick was really scared so he started shouting to scare the lion away. But the shouting did nothing but attract the lion's attention and it began walking towards him. He then realized he should have left it alone. 
 To escape, Frederick gave the lion a lamb. While the lion was occupied, he led the rest of the flock away. Eventually, he guessed they were far enough away to be safe from the lion. So he took a nap on the grass.
 However, when he awoke he notice another lamb was missing and he could not find it anywhere! At the next opportunity, Frederick bought a blunderbuss so he could better defend his flock in the future.

Story A: Zebediah, the old miser, was sitting on his back porch counting his money and he dozed off. When he awoke he discovered that one bag of coins was missing. He could not find the bag anywhere. Zebediah figured that the thief was still nearby so he started yelling for whoever took the money to show his face.
 Suddenly, a beggar came out of the forsythia bushes and started walking towards the old man on the porch. Zebediah was surprised and very frightened. He wished he had left the beggar alone. 
 To escape, he threw a second bag of coins to the beggar. While the beggar was occupied, Zebediah took the last few bags of money into the house and locked the door!

Story B: Zebediah, the old miser, was sitting on his back porch counting his money. Suddenly, a beggar came out of the forsythia bushes.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the stories.

The reference story (Ref) is about Frederick, a shepherd who is attacked by a lion. He gives the lion a lamb to distract it and escapes with the rest of the flock.

Story A and Story B both seem to be about Zebediah, an old miser who is attacked by a beggar. However, there are some differences between the two stories.

In Story A, Zebediah yells at the beggar, which attracts the beggar's attention. He then throws a second bag of coins to distract the beggar and escapes with the remaining money.

In Story B, Zebediah also yells at the beggar, but only throws one bag of coins to distract the beggar. He then escapes with the remaining money and dozes off, only to discover that another bag of coins is missing.

The key similarity between the reference story and Story A is that both involve a protagonist who is attacked by a predator (lion or beggar) and uses a distraction technique (giving a lamb or throwing a bag of coins) to escape. This is not present in Story B, where Zebediah simply throws one bag of coins and escapes.

Therefore, I believe that Story A is analogous to the reference story.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the stories step by step.

First, let's identify the key elements in the reference story (Ref):

* Mark, a chicken farmer, is collecting eggs in the henhouse.
* The chickens suddenly attack him for unknown reasons.
* Mark is chased out of the henhouse and into the woods.
* A thief steals the unguarded eggs.
* Mark quits chicken farming and goes on a vacation.

Now, let's compare these elements to Story A:

* Linda, the director of a girl scout camp, is thinking about the camp on the beach.
* The girl scouts return and start pestering her with questions.
* Linda runs off the beach and down the road, screaming at the scouts.
* The scouts follow her, still yelling.

The elements don't match exactly, but there are some similarities. However, the key element of the chickens attacking Mark for unknown reasons is not present in Story A.

Now, let's compare these elements to Story B:

* A tidal wave hits a girl scout camp on the beach, washing away the sleeping bags.
* Linda, the camp director, returns and finds the tragedy.
* She stands on the beach thinking about what to do.
* The girl scouts return from hiking and attack Linda, asking what they will do now and where they will sleep.
* Linda runs down the road, screaming at the scouts.

Ah-ha! Now we see the key element of the chickens attacking Mark for unknown reasons is present in Story B, but not in Story A. Additionally, the sequence of events in Story B matches the sequence in the reference story more closely.

Therefore, I conclude that Story B is analogous to the reference story.

* A sudden and unexpected event (the tidal wave vs. the chickens attacking) that causes chaos and disruption.
* The main character (Linda) is overwhelmed and frustrated by the situation.
* The secondary characters (the girl scouts) are demanding and unappreciative.

Story B, on the other hand, does not have a sudden and unexpected event that causes chaos. Instead, it describes a more mundane situation where the girl scouts are pestering Linda about dinner and swimming. The story only mentions the tidal wave at the end, which is not a key element in the reference story.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the stories step by step.

The reference story (Ref) is about two pioneers, Smith and Johnson, who discover a valley and fight over it. They are eventually divided by a third party, Sheriff Jones, and become friends.

Story A is about two people, Betty and Norma, who discover a twenty-dollar bill and argue over it. Their teacher, Mrs. Lee, intervenes and divides the money between them. They then realize they should have done it themselves.

Story B is also about two people, Betty and Norma, who discover a twenty-dollar bill and argue over it. However, their teacher, Lee, takes the money for herself, and by the time Betty and Norma realize they should have divided it, it's too late.

Now, let's look for similarities between the stories. Both Story A and Ref have a third party (Sheriff Jones/Mrs. Lee) intervene and divide the disputed item (valley/money) between the two protagonists. In both stories, the protagonists eventually realize they should have done it themselves.

Story B, on the other hand, does not have a third party intervene to divide the disputed item. Instead, the teacher takes the money for herself, which is a different outcome.

Based on the similarities between Ref and Story A, I believe that Story A is analogous to the reference story.

Therefore, the final answer is:

In the reference story (Ref), two pioneers, Smith and Johnson, discover a valley and fight over who saw it first. Sheriff Jones intervenes and divides the land evenly between them. In the end, they become friends and help each other build their houses.

Now, let's look at Story A:

* Betty and Norma discover a twenty-dollar bill on the floor.
* They argue over who saw it first.
* Lee takes the money, and by the time they realize they should divide it, it's too late.

This story doesn't have a resolution similar to the reference story. The money is taken by Lee, and the two women don't end up dividing it or becoming friends.

Now, let's look at Story B:

* Betty and Norma discover a twenty-dollar bill on the floor.
* They argue over who saw it first.
* Mrs. Lee, their teacher, takes the money and divides it between them.
* Betty and Norma realize they should have divided it themselves.

This story has a similar resolution to the reference story. Just like in the reference story, the third party (Mrs. Lee) intervenes and divides the money evenly between the two women. This is the key similarity that makes Story B analogous to the reference story.

In Story B, McGhee, a sailor, tries to blow up the captain's cabin using dynamite due to his impatience. Later, the captain announces that he will be taking a vacation in the mountains, but everyone else will have to remain on board to repair the ship.

Comparing the three stories, I notice that in both the reference story (Ref) and Story A, the protagonist (Mrs. Jackson/McGhee) is denied something they want (salary increase/vacation) and then takes revenge on the person who denied them (principal/captain).

Story A is about a boy named Gene and a policeman. The boy hits the policeman, and the policeman grabs the boy and drives away. Unfortunately, the policeman becomes too dizzy to drive, and they both die in a car accident.

Story B is also about a boy named Gene and a policeman. However, the sequence of events is slightly different. In this story, the policeman grabs the boy, and then the boy hits the policeman. The rest of the story is the same as in Story A.

Now, let's look for similarities between the stories. We can see that all three stories involve a person (or animal) striking another person, followed by the struck person grabbing the striker and taking them away. This is a key similarity between the stories.

However, there is one key difference between the stories. In the reference story (Ref), the falcon grabs the cobra before the cobra strikes. In both Story A and Story B, the policeman grabs the boy after the boy strikes the policeman.

Based on this analysis, I believe that Story B is the most analogous to the reference story (Ref). In both stories, the person who is grabbed by the other person strikes them first, and then the grabbed person takes them away. This is the key similarity between the two stories.

Therefore, my final answer is:

<ans> B </ans>",,B,A

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the stories.

The reference story (Ref) is about a cobra named Pierre and a falcon. The cobra attacks the falcon, and they both die in a tragic accident.

Story A and Story B both involve a character named Gene and a policeman. Gene panics and hits the policeman, and they both die in a car accident.

The key similarity between the reference story and Story A/B is the theme of a character panicking and causing a tragic accident that results in their own death, along with the death of another person.

However, there is a crucial difference between the reference story and Story A. In the reference story, the falcon grabs the cobra and flies away with it, whereas in Story A, the policeman grabs Gene and drives away with him. This difference suggests that the policeman in Story A is not simply a passive victim, but rather an active participant in the events that unfold.

In contrast, Story B is more similar to the reference story in this regard. The policeman in Story B grabs Gene and drives away with him, just like the falcon grabs the cobra in the reference story. This similarity suggests that Story B may be the more analogous story.

Therefore, my final answer is:

<ans> B </ans>",,B,B
