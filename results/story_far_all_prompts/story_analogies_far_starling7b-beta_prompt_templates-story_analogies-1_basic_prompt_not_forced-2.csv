Story B is more analogous to the source story for several reasons. In both stories, the main character struggles with their current situation (William with his messy room and poor hygiene, Karen with her poor academic performance), and they both spend a significant amount of time daydreaming about something they desire (William about food, Karen about Hawaii). Additionally, both stories involve a promise made by a significant figure in their lives (a nurse in William's case, Karen's father in Story B) as an incentive to improve their situation.

In both stories, the characters fail to meet the conditions of the promise due to their inability to change their circumstances in time, resulting in disappointment and a lack of reward. The parallels between the two stories make Story B the more analogous comparison to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

Story B is more analogous to the source story for several reasons. In both stories, the main character (William in the source story and Karen in Story B) struggles with maintaining a clean and organized living space, leading to negative consequences (failed room inspections and not graduating). Both characters are motivated by the promise of a reward (gingerbread for William, a trip to Hawaii for Karen), but ultimately fail to achieve the reward due to insufficient effort and time constraints. Additionally, both characters spend a significant amount of time daydreaming about the reward, which contributes to their inability to meet the necessary requirements.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

In both stories, the accident leads to the recommendation of a safety feature (safety razor in the source story and warning label in Story A), which the manager then considers absolutely necessary and implements immediately.

In both stories, the main character (Joseph in the source story and Alexander in Story A) boasts about having a resource (chauffeur for Joseph, wife for Alexander) that would ensure a certain outcome (never being late for conferences, always eating well).

Story B is more analogous to the source story for the following reasons:

1. Both the source story and Story B involve a character who boasts about having something (a chauffeur in the source story, a wife in Story B) that will ensure a certain outcome (punctuality for conferences, always having dinner).
2. In both stories, the character faces a situation where their boastful claim doesn't come true due to miscommunication or misunderstanding (the chauffeur being asleep, the wives thinking Alexander would eat elsewhere).
3. As a result of the initial failure, the character in both stories takes action to prevent the issue from happening again (hiring a second chauffeur, marrying a second wife).

While Story A also involves a character who boasts about having something (two wives) and faces a situation where their claim doesn't come true, the overall structure and themes of the story are different from the source story. In Story A, the character's boast is about having two wives for companionship and food, while in the source story, the boast is about punctuality and the character's wealth. Additionally, the consequences and resolutions in Story A are not as closely aligned with those in the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

# Source Story:
Peter was a young man from Iceland who moved to Florida one summer. He was very self-conscious about his fair skin. Peter thought that people would not accept him unless he tanned himself golden-brown like every one else.
So Peter spent a whole day in the sun, trying to get a tan. He didn't understand how dangerous the sun could be. Consequently, by evening he had second degree burns over most of his body and he had to go to the hospital. Peter decided that Florida was not for him and booked the next ocean liner back to Iceland. He spent the whole trip under a large umbrella keeping cool.

Story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, the main character (Peter in the source story and Quiggly Company in Story B) is influenced by the actions of others and the desire to fit in or keep up with the competition. In the source story, Peter sees everyone else tanning and decides to do the same, ignoring the dangers of sun exposure. In Story B, Quiggly Company sees others succeeding in space manufacturing and decides to follow suit, despite warnings about the financial risks and competitive nature of the market.

In contrast, Story A does not have a direct parallel to the source story. In Story A, Quiggly Company makes a calculated decision to enter the integrated circuit market, but underestimates the financial risk involved. The company's decision is not driven by a desire to fit in or keep up with the competition, but rather by a misjudgment of the market conditions.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

Story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, the protagonist (Peter in the source story and Quiggly Company in Story B) is faced with a challenge or opportunity that seems desirable but comes with significant risks. Peter risks severe sunburn by trying to tan like everyone else, while Quiggly Company risks financial ruin by investing in expensive space factories. In both cases, the protagonists learn a valuable lesson about the dangers of following the crowd and the importance of understanding the risks involved in their actions. Story A, on the other hand, does not share these same themes and is not as analogous to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

2. In both stories, one individual (Ivan, Christine) makes a mistake that causes problems for the partnership or relationship.
3. In both stories, the other individual (Boris, John) reacts to the mistake by placing restrictions on the first individual's involvement in certain aspects of their shared endeavor (monetary matters, driving the car).
4. In both stories, the second individual (Ivan, Christine) later redeems themselves by taking action that compensates for their earlier mistake (selling a stereo set, not denting the car again).

Story B is more analogous to the source story because both involve a smaller entity (Bolon/Lincoln and Salam/Moreland) trying to make the best of a dangerous situation by appeasing a larger, aggressive entity (Mayonia/Chad). In both stories, the smaller entities end up being overpowered and taken advantage of by the larger, aggressive entity, despite their attempts to protect themselves. Additionally, the source story and Story B both involve a third party (Salam/Moreland) who tries to negotiate with the aggressive entity (Mayonia/Chad) but ultimately fails.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

Story B is more analogous to the source story because it shares the following key elements:

1. Two smaller entities (Bolon and Salam in the source story, Lincoln and Moreland in Story B) are in a vulnerable situation due to the presence of a larger, more powerful entity (Mayonia in the source story, Chad in Story B).
2. The smaller entities try to make the best of the situation by making a deal with the larger entity (Bolon proposing a treaty with Mayonia, Moreland offering to help Chad rob Lincoln).
3. Despite their efforts, the smaller entities are ultimately overpowered by the larger entity (Mayonia overrunning Bolon and Salam, Chad robbing both Lincoln and Moreland).

In both stories, the smaller entities' attempts to protect themselves by making deals with the larger entity fail, and they end up being controlled by the larger entity. This makes Story B more analogous to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

Story A is more analogous to the source story because both stories involve a person valuing a particular item (a tree in the source story and a canary in Story A) above all the rest. In both stories, the item begins to wither or become ill, causing disappointment among those who enjoyed it. However, a third party who also appreciated the item steps in to take care of it, paying the original owner well for the transfer. After being moved, the item regains its former glory and continues to bring joy to those who appreciate it.

As a result, the house was no longer livable. Cornelius decided that Agatha was right and he went back to thinking about nothing but astronomy.
Then, one evening when Cornelius was walking through his house, an unfinished floor collapsed under his weight. Cornelius was severely injured but the accident showed him that he should try to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.

Story A is more analogous to the source story because both involve a character who is obsessed with one aspect of their life (King Otto with conquest and riches, Cornelius with astronomy) and neglects another important aspect (King Otto with domestic expenditures, Cornelius with maintaining his home). In both stories, a mishap (King Otto's carriage crashing through an unfinished bridge, Cornelius's floor collapsing) leads to a realization that they need to balance their priorities. After the incident, both characters make an effort to balance their interests (King Otto with military and domestic expenditures, Cornelius with astronomy and home maintenance).<|end_of_turn|>",,A,B

Story A is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, the main character (Frederick in the source story and Zebediah in Story A) is faced with a dangerous situation (a lion and a beggar, respectively) and tries to escape by giving the threat something of value (a lamb and a bag of coins, respectively). Both characters then realize that their actions did not completely solve the problem (the lamb is still missing and another bag of coins is missing), leading them to take further action (buying a blunderbuss and locking the door). The structure and themes of the two stories are quite similar, making Story A the more analogous comparison story to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,A

Story B is more analogous to the source story for the following reasons:

1. Both stories involve a protagonist who is away from their main responsibility (Mark from the henhouse and Linda from the girl scout camp) and return to find chaos or disaster (stolen eggs and destroyed sleeping bags, respectively).
2. In both stories, the protagonist is confronted by their charges (chickens and girl scouts) who are upset or confused about the situation, leading to a conflict.
3. Both stories have an element of unexpected disaster (the thief stealing the eggs and the tidal wave destroying the camp) that has consequences for the protagonist and their situation.

While Story A shares some similarities with the source story, such as the protagonist being confronted by their charges and an unexpected disaster, it lacks the specific elements of the source story, such as the protagonist's initial absence and the direct connection between the protagonist's absence and the disaster. Therefore, Story B is more analogous to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

Story B is more analogous to the source story for the following reasons:

1. Both stories involve a character who is away from their responsibility (Mark in the henhouse and Linda at the girl scout camp) and returns to find their charges acting ungrateful or causing chaos.
2. In both stories, the main character is frustrated with the ungrateful behavior of the animals/girl scouts and screams at them.
3. After the main character leaves, a negative event occurs (theft of eggs in the source story, tidal wave in Story B), which further complicates the situation.
4. Both stories have a sense of irony, as the main character is not directly responsible for the negative event, yet they are still blamed or affected by it.

While Story A does involve a situation where the characters return to find a problem, the key elements of frustration, ungrateful behavior, and a negative event occurring after the main character leaves are not as strongly present as in Story B.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

Story B is more analogous to the source story because in both stories, a character becomes upset due to perceived unfairness and decides to take revenge. In the source story, Mrs. Jackson is upset about not receiving a salary increase while the principal gets one, and she decides to set fire to his office. In Story B, McGhee is upset about not being allowed vacation time while the captain takes his own vacation, and he decides to blow up the captain's cabin.

In contrast, Story A involves McGhee becoming upset because he is not allowed vacation time and then taking revenge by blowing up the captain's cabin, but the captain's decision to take a vacation in the mountains comes after the incident, rather than being the direct cause of McGhee's anger.

Story B is more analogous to the source story because in both stories, a character (Mrs. Jackson in the source story and McGhee in Story B) becomes upset due to perceived unfairness (salary increase for the principal but not for the teachers, and vacation time for the captain but not for the sailors) and decides to take revenge by causing destruction (setting fire to the principal's office and blowing up the captain's cabin). In Story A, the captain's decision to take a vacation in the mountains does not provoke the same level of anger or retaliation from McGhee, making it less analogous to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

Story B is more analogous to the source story for the following reasons:

1. Both the source story and Story B involve a conflict between two characters (Pierre and the falcon, Gene and the policeman) that leads to a dangerous situation.
2. In both stories, one character becomes weak or incapacitated (the falcon is wounded, the policeman becomes dizzy), leading to a tragic outcome for both characters.
3. The source story and Story B both end with the characters perishing in a dramatic and unexpected location (the outdoor wedding ceremony, the wall).

While Story A has some similarities with the source story, such as the conflict between two characters and the tragic outcome, it does not have the same structure and progression of events as the source story. In Story A, the conflict occurs after the characters are already in motion, whereas in the source story and Story B, the conflict arises as the characters interact.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

Story B is more analogous to the source story for the following reasons:

1. Both stories involve a conflict between two characters, where one character (Pierre the cobra and Gene) reacts aggressively towards the other (the falcon and the policeman).
2. In both stories, the aggressive action leads to unintended consequences for both characters, resulting in their demise.
3. The source story and Story B both have elements of irony, as the characters' actions lead to their own downfall. In the source story, Pierre strikes the falcon out of fear, and both end up dying. In Story B, Gene hits the policeman out of panic, and they both die in a car accident.
4. The source story and Story B both involve a lesson or consequence for the characters' actions. In the source story, the falcon teaches Pierre a lesson by carrying him away. In Story B, the policeman tries to set Gene straight by taking him away, but ends up teaching him a lesson in a tragic way.

While Story A involves a conflict and unintended consequences, it lacks the elements of irony and the lesson or consequence that are present in both the source story and Story B.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B
