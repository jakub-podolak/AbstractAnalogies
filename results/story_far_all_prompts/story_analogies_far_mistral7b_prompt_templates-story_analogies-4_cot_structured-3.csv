In all three stories, there is a character who is motivated by an external reward to improve their situation but ultimately fails to achieve it due to their own shortcomings. The characters, William, Karen in Story A, and Karen in Story B, all spend a significant amount of time daydreaming or hating their current situation instead of taking necessary actions to improve it. The external reward acts as an incentive, but the characters are unable to meet the requirements to receive it.

2. The characters in all three stories have a negative relationship with their current situations and are motivated by external rewards to change it. However, their inability to meet the requirements to receive the reward results in disappointment and frustration. In the source story, William's frustration leads him to sulk and damage property, while in both Karen stories, the characters do not receive the reward and are left disappointed.

3. The narrative structure of all three stories follows a similar pattern. There is a description of the character's current situation and their dissatisfaction with it. An external reward is introduced as a motivation for the character to improve their situation. The character makes an effort to achieve the reward but ultimately fails. The stories all have a clear beginning, middle, and end, with a focus on the character's failure to achieve their goal.

4. Both Story A and Story B share similarities with the Source Story in terms of the themes and character development. However, in Story A, the character's name is the same, and the external reward is also food-related, making it a closer match.

5. <ans> A </ans>

The similarities between Story A and the Source Story outweigh the differences, with both stories having the same character name and a food-related external reward. Additionally, the narrative structure and character development follow a similar pattern. Therefore, Story A is more closely related to the Source Story.</s>",,A,A

The inventor or supplier then recommends a safety feature or warning label to prevent similar accidents in the future. The main character initially disregards the recommendation but later comes to consider it necessary after experiencing the accident firsthand.

2. In the Source Story and Story A, the main characters are managers (Mr. Newton and Ms. Boyce) who oversee the production or installation of a product (razors and heat lamps, respectively). They both have accidents involving the new invention and subsequently implement the recommended safety feature. In Story B, the main character is also Ms. Boyce, but she initially disregards the recommendation for warning labels and only implements them after her accident. The development of the characters in all three stories follows a similar trajectory, with the accident serving as a catalyst for change.

3. The narrative structure of all three stories is similar in that they follow a chronological order of events: the invention, the accident, and the implementation of the safety feature or warning label. However, the order in which the recommendation is made and the character's initial response to it differ between the stories.

4. Based on the comparisons, Story A is more closely related to the Source Story as both involve a manager, an invention, an accident, and the implementation of a safety feature after the accident.

In Story B, the wealthy man has two wives, and both fail to provide for him, leading him to go without dinner.

2. In Story A, Alexander's solution to his problem is to marry a second wife, which could be seen as an extreme and potentially harmful solution.

In Story B, Alexander also has only one wife who fails to prepare food for him, but his solution is to marry a second wife to ensure that he is always provided for. Joseph, in the Source Story, hires a second chauffeur to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

The characters in all three stories are similar in that they are wealthy men who make assumptions about the availability of resources or services and are disappointed when they are not met. They both react by acquiring additional resources or people to ensure that they are never without.

3. The narrative structure of Story A and Story B is similar to the Source Story in that they all follow a pattern of the man making an assumption, being disappointed, and then taking action to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. However, the specific details of each story differ. In Story A, Alexander has two wives, while in the Source Story, Joseph has only one chauffeur. In Story B, Alexander also has only one wife, but he marries a second wife as a solution, while Joseph hires a second chauffeur.

4. Based on the comparisons, Story B is more closely related to the Source Story as both involve a wealthy man, making an assumption about the availability of a resource or service, being disappointed, and then taking action to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. In both stories, the man hires an additional resource or person to ensure that he is always provided for.

3/ Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.
4/ Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.
5/ State the final answer. Provide final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>","1. In all three stories, there is a conflict between two parties: Karla and the hunter, Zerdia and Gagrach. In both Story A and the Source Story, the conflict is resolved through negotiation and compromise, with the more powerful party (the hunter, Gagrach) agreeing to cease their hostile actions towards the other (Karla, Zerdia) in exchange for something they desire (hawk feathers, Zerdian computers). In Story B, however, the conflict is not fully resolved, as Zerdia is ultimately defeated and its supercomputers are used against it.
2. In the Source Story, Karla is portrayed as a wise and cunning hawk who uses her intelligence and resourcefulness to save her life and ensure her safety. In Story A, Zerdia is depicted as a resourceful and innovative country that uses its technological prowess to secure peace with its neighbor. In Story B, Zerdia is shown to be naive and trusting, allowing its technology to fall into the hands of its enemy and ultimately leading to its downfall.
3. The narrative structure of Story A is similar to that of the Source Story in that both stories follow a conflict resolution model, with the more powerful party agreeing to a peaceful resolution in exchange for what they want. The structure of Story B, however, is different in that it follows a more traditional conflict and resolution model, with a build-up of tension leading to a climax and resolution.
4. While both Story A and Story B involve conflicts between two parties and peaceful resolutions, the themes and character development in Story B are more distinct from the Source Story. In Story B, the peaceful resolution is ultimately unsuccessful, and the narrative follows a more traditional conflict and resolution structure.
5. Based on the comparisons, Story A is less closely related to the Source Story as it deviates from the themes and character development of the Source Story. In contrast, Story B shares some similarities with the Source Story in terms of the conflict and resolution, but also includes elements that distinguish it from the Source Story.

In all three stories, there is a character who goes out into the world and returns home with the expectation of receiving something in return for a gift or a performance. However, the homecoming is met with disappointment and rejection, leading the character to feel dejected and consider giving up on their endeavors.

2. In Story A, the mother's rejection of Sam's gift and refusal to give him a loan is based on her perception of the gift as worthless. In Story B, her rejection is based on her belief that Sam has been wasting his time while she has been working. In the Source Story, the squirrel's rejection of Percy's song is based on her displeasure with his singing ability. In all three stories, the characters' expectations are dashed, leading to feelings of disappointment and self-doubt.

3. The narrative structure of all three stories follows a similar pattern of the character going out into the world, returning home with a gift or a performance, and being met with rejection. However, in Story A, the reason for the mother's rejection is revealed earlier in the story, while in the Source Story and Story B, the reason is revealed during the interaction between the character and the homecoming figure.

4. Based on the themes, character development, and narrative structure, Story B is more closely related to the Source Story. In both stories, the rejection is based on the homecoming figure's perception of the character's actions or abilities, rather than the gift or performance itself. Additionally, in both stories, the character is met with disappointment and considers giving up on their endeavors.

2. In Story A, Moreland is portrayed as a cowardly and weak character who is easily intimidated by Chad. He makes a desperate attempt to make a deal with Chad to save himself, but ultimately fails. In the Source Story, Bolon is depicted as a smaller country that tries to make a treaty with Mayonia to ensure its survival, but ends up being overrun and controlled. The characters in both stories are motivated by a desire to survive, but their actions ultimately lead to their downfall.

3. In Story B, the roles of Lincoln and Moreland are reversed compared to Story A. Moreland initially tries to help Lincoln, but ends up betraying him and becoming a part of the problem. The narrative structure in Story B is similar to that of the Source Story in that the smaller entities make deals with the larger entity, only to end up being controlled.

In all three stories, there are two smaller entities (Bolon/Salam, Lincoln, Moreland) that are threatened by a larger, more powerful entity (Mayonia, Chad). In an attempt to protect themselves or make the best of the situation, the smaller entities make deals or take actions that ultimately lead to their downfall. In both Story A and Story B, Moreland/Lincoln are unable to prevent the larger entity from overpowering them and taking control.

2. In the Source Story, Bolon's decision to take over Salam and make a treaty with Mayonia ultimately leads to its downfall. In Story A and Story B, Moreland's decision to make a deal with Chad in order to save himself results in both him and Lincoln being robbed. In all three stories, the smaller entities' attempts to protect themselves lead to their subjugation.

3. The narrative structure of the Source Story is more complex as it involves multiple countries and political maneuvering. In contrast, Story A and Story B have a simpler structure with only two characters and a focus on their interactions with Chad.

In all three stories, there is a character who is given advice or instructions by another character, but the character disregards the advice and ends up facing negative consequences as a result. In Story A and the Source Story, the characters are motivated by a desire to do something they are not supposed to do (Jenny playing in her neighbor's yard and Morris playing his harmonica at night, respectively), while in Story B, the character is motivated by a misunderstanding of the advice given (Jenny thinking her neighbor meant she should play with her dog every day at the playground instead of in her own yard).

Morris is portrayed as simple-minded and easily influenced by his cellmate, Jenny in Story A is disobedient and stubborn, and Jenny in Story B is also disobedient but motivated by a misunderstanding.

3. The narrative structure of all three stories follows a similar pattern of advice given, disobedience, and negative consequences. However, the specific details and motivations vary. In Story A, the character's disobedience is driven by a desire to do something forbidden, while in Story B, it is driven by a misunderstanding of the advice given.

In all three stories, the protagonist encounters an unexpected threat (lion in Ref, beggar in A and B) that they initially try to scare away or escape from. The protagonist then makes a sacrifice (lamb in Ref, bags of coins in A and B) to distract the threat and save themselves. However, they later discover that something valuable has been taken from them. In response, the protagonist takes measures to better protect themselves in the future.

2. In the Source Story, Frederick is a shepherd who is scared of a lion and sacrifices a lamb to save himself and his flock. In Story A, Zebediah is an old miser who is scared of a beggar and sacrifices a bag of coins to save himself. In Story B, Zebediah is an old miser who is scared of a beggar and sacrifices another bag of coins to save himself. The characters in all three stories are motivated by fear and make sacrifices to protect themselves.

3. The narrative structure of all three stories follows a similar pattern of encountering a threat, making a sacrifice, and taking measures to protect oneself in the future. However, the specific details of the threats and sacrifices differ.

4. Both Story A and Story B share similarities with the Source Story in terms of the themes and character development. However, Story A has some differences in the specific details of the threat and the sacrifice. In Story A, the threat is a beggar and the sacrifice is a bag of coins, whereas in the Source Story, the threat is a lion and the sacrifice is a lamb.

5. Based on the comparisons, both Story A and Story B are related to the Source Story as they share similar themes and character development. However, Story A has some differences in the specific details of the threat and the sacrifice. Therefore, it is more accurate to say that Story B is more closely related to the Source Story as it has fewer differences in the narrative structure.

In the end, an external figure intervenes and resolves the conflict by dividing the valuable thing between the characters. The characters then come to the realization that they should have cooperated and divided it amicably on their own.

2. In Story A, the characters Betty and Norma have a similar dynamic to Smith and Johnson in the Source Story. They both want the same thing and argue over it, but eventually come to the understanding that they should have worked together. The intervention of their teacher, Mrs. Lee, is similar to Sheriff Jones in the Source Story, as she resolves the conflict and helps the characters learn a valuable lesson.

3. The narrative structure of Story A is similar to the Source Story in that the conflict arises from a desire for a valuable object, and is resolved through the intervention of an external figure. However, in Story A, the characters do not come to the realization of their error until after the external figure has taken the money. In the Source Story, the characters come to this realization before the intervention of Sheriff Jones.

In Story B, the external figure, Lee, takes the money for herself instead of dividing it between the characters. This means that the conflict is not resolved in the same way as in the Source Story or in Story A. Additionally, the characters in Story B do not come to the realization of their error until after the external figure has taken the money, which is also different from the Source Story and Story A.

5. Based on the comparisons, Story A is more closely related to the Source Story as it follows the same conflict resolution pattern and the characters come to the realization of their error before the intervention of an external figure.

In all three stories, there are two characters who discover something valuable and want it for themselves, leading to a conflict. In the reference story and Story B, a third party intervenes and resolves the conflict by dividing the valuable thing evenly between the characters. In Story A, however, the third party takes the valuable thing for herself and the characters miss an opportunity to divide it fairly. The theme of cooperation and mutual understanding is present in all three stories, but in Story A, the characters miss an opportunity to learn this lesson on their own.
2. In the reference story, Smith and Johnson become friends after realizing they should have divided the land fairly. In Story B, Betty and Norma also become friends after this realization, but in Story A, they do not have the opportunity to make amends. The characters in all three stories are portrayed as human and fallible, making mistakes and learning from them.
3. The narrative structure of all three stories is similar in that they follow a conflict between two characters over a valuable thing, followed by a resolution. In the reference story and Story B, the resolution comes from a third party intervening and dividing the thing fairly. In Story A, the resolution comes too late and the characters miss an opportunity to divide it fairly.
