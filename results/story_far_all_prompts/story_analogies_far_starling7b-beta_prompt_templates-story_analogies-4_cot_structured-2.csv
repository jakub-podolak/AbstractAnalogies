# Story A:
Once there was a small country called Zerdia that learned to make the world's smartest computer. One day Zerdia was attacked by its warlike neighbor, Gagrach. But the missiles were badly aimed and the attack failed. The Zerdian government realized that Gagrach wanted Zerdian computers so it offered to sell some of its computers to the country. The government of Gagrach was very pleased. It promised never to attack Zerdia again.

# Story B:

In Story A, the themes include technological advancement, diplomacy, and peace through trade. In Story B, the themes involve deception, manipulation, and the potential for betrayal.

2/ Character Relationships: In the Source Story, Karla the hawk and the hunter have a direct interaction, with Karla offering her feathers to avoid conflict. In Story A, Zerdia and Gagrach interact through diplomacy and trade, while in Story B, Zerdia and Gagrach interact through deception and manipulation.

3/ Narrative Structure: The Source Story has a clear conflict (the hunter wanting Karla's feathers) that is resolved through cooperation. Story A has a similar structure, with conflict (Gagrach's attack) resolved through trade. Story B, however, has a more complex structure, with the resolution (Gagrach's promise not to attack) ultimately proven false.

4/ Based on the comparisons, Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories involve a conflict that is resolved through the exchange of valuable resources, leading to a peaceful resolution. In contrast, Story B introduces a more complex narrative with deception and betrayal, which is not present in the Source Story.

# Source Story:
Two pioneers, Smith and Johnson, discovered a gorgeous little valley that was as yet unclaimed in Oregon Territory. Each of them wanted the land for himself, so soon they were fighting over who saw it first.
 While they were fighting over it, Sheriff Jones came along and divided the land evenly between them. In the end, Smith and Johnson realized that they should have done that on their own. From that day forward they were the best of friends, and they helped build each others' houses.

# Story A:
Betty and Norma were walking towards each other, when they simultaneously discovered a twenty dollar bill on the floor. Both of them wanted the money so soon they were arguing desperately over who saw it first.
 While they were busy arguing, their teacher Mrs. Lee, came along, took the money and divided it between them. Then Betty and Norma realized that they should have done that themselves.

4/ Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.
5/ State the final answer. Provide final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>","1/ Themes: In all three stories, the central theme is conflict over a shared resource (land in the Source Story, money in Stories A and B) and the eventual realization that cooperation would have been a better solution. The characters learn a valuable lesson about sharing and collaboration.

2/ Character Development: In the Source Story, Smith and Johnson go from fighting over the land to becoming the best of friends and helping each other build houses. In Story A, Betty and Norma also start as rivals over the money but end up learning the same lesson and potentially becoming friends. In Story B, the relationship between Betty and Norma is not as clearly resolved, as Lee takes the money and leaves them without a chance to reconcile.

3/ Narrative Structure: All three stories follow a similar structure: two characters discover a shared resource, they fight over it, an external figure intervenes and divides the resource, and the characters realize they should have done it themselves. However, in Story B, the external figure (Lee) takes the money for herself, leaving Betty and Norma without a chance to learn the lesson together.

4/ Based on the comparisons, Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories involve two characters fighting over a shared resource, an external figure intervening and dividing the resource, and the characters learning a lesson about cooperation. In contrast, Story B deviates from this structure with the external figure taking the resource for herself, leaving the characters without a chance to learn the lesson together.
