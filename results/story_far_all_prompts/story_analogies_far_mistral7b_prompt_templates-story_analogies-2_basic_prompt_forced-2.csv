Explanation: In both stories, the characters have a strong desire for something external that motivates them but ultimately fail to achieve it due to their current circumstances. However, in Story A, the character's failure to achieve her goal directly results from her excessive daydreaming about it, while in Story B, the character's failure is due to her poor academic performance. The source story is more analogous to Story A because William's failure to pass the inspection and receive the gingerbread is directly related to his excessive daydreaming about the food.</s>",,A,B

Explanation: In both stories, an employee is introduced to a new product with improved features, but they or someone else experiences an accident that leads to the implementation of a safety feature. However, the key difference lies in who initiated the recommendation for the safety feature. In Story A, the supplier recommended the warning label after the accident, but Ms. Boyce initially considered it unnecessary. In contrast, in Story B, the supplier recommended the warning label immediately after the accident, and Ms. Boyce considered it necessary. Therefore, Story A is less analogous to the source story as the sequence of events does not perfectly match.</s>",,A,B

Explanation: In both stories, there is a man who makes a claim about always having something (Joseph having a chauffeur to be on time, Alexander having wives to ensure he eats well), but then experiences a situation where he does not have that thing and goes without it. In Story A, the man solves the problem by acquiring an additional version of the thing (a second wife).

Explanation: In both stories, a character (Peter and Quiggly Company) makes a decision based on a belief that they need to conform to a certain standard (getting a tan to fit in and manufacturing space components to compete), but they underestimate the risks involved and suffer significant consequences as a result. In Story A, Quiggly Company's decision to invest in space manufacturing leads to financial ruin, while in Story B, the company is warned against this decision by market analysts and chooses to avoid the risk. However, in the source story, Peter's decision to get a tan despite the risks results in physical harm, while in Story A, Quiggly Company's decision results in financial harm. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story as both involve a character making a risky decision based on a belief that they need to conform, resulting in significant negative consequences.</s>",,A,A

Explanation: In both stories, the main character (Peter and Quiggly Company) take a risk that ultimately leads to negative consequences. However, in Story A, Quiggly Company is warned against entering a risky market but chooses to ignore the warning and go back to their old business. In Story B, Quiggly Company enters a new market and takes on a significant financial risk without fully understanding the consequences. The source story of Peter's experience in Florida can be more directly compared to Story B, as Peter also takes a risk (by overexposing himself to the sun) without fully understanding the potential harm.</s>",,B,B

Explanation: In both stories, the characters encounter something they desire but cannot obtain due to financial limitations. However, the key difference lies in their initial thoughts and reactions towards the desired objects. In the source story, Julius is initially skeptical about the pears and believes they are rotten, but is disappointed when he cannot reach them. In Story B, Cindy is initially curious about the records and wants to buy them to confirm her hunch, but is disappointed when she cannot afford them. In Story A, Cindy dismisses the records as boring without even trying them, making her reaction less analogous to Julius's experience.</s>",,B,B

Explanation: In both stories, there is a character who is told to do something differently but ignores the advice and ends up getting into trouble. In Story A, the little girl refuses to play in her own yard because she believes it's bad luck, while in Story B, she goes to the playground instead of doing her chores because she thinks she should always play with her dog in her neighbor's yard. In the source story, Morris is told to play his harmonica during the day but ignores his cellmate and plays at night, leading to his capture.

Therefore, Story B is more analogous to the source story as both involve a character being given advice but choosing to ignore it, resulting in negative consequences.</s>",,B,B

Explanation: Both stories involve an individual who is obsessed with their passion to the point of neglecting other important aspects of their life. In the source story, King Otto neglects the maintenance of his kingdom's bridges in favor of military conquests. In Story A, Cornelius neglects the maintenance of his home in favor of astronomy. The key difference is that in the source story, it is the chamberlain who points out the problem and the king learns his lesson after an accident. In Story A, it is Cornelius' wife who points out the problem and the lesson is learned after an accident. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story as the structure of the stories is similar, with the only difference being the identity of the person who points out the problem.</s>",,A,A

Explanation: In both stories, there is an obsessed individual (King Otto and Cornelius) who neglects their domestic responsibilities for their respective obsessions (bridges and astronomy). However, in Story A, the wife's complaint about the neglected home leads to an accident that injures the husband, making him realize the importance of balancing his time. In Story B, the husband initially listens to his wife's complaint and tries to balance his time, but then abandons the effort and returns to his obsession, leading to an accident that injures him and reinforces the need for balance. The source story is more analogous to Story A because, in the source story, the king's neglect of domestic responsibilities leads to an accident that injures him and makes him realize the importance of balancing military and domestic expenditures, without him initially trying to balance his time and then abandoning the effort.</s>",,A,B

Explanation: In both stories, the protagonist initially tries to scare off the threat by shouting, but this only attracts more attention. They then give something valuable to the threat to buy time to escape. However, in Story A, the threat is a beggar, while in Story B, the threat is not explicitly stated to be a thief until the end. In the source story, the threat is a lion, which is a natural predator and is explicitly stated. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story as it follows the same pattern of events with a similar type of threat (a person who is initially perceived as dangerous and then turns out to have taken something).</s>",,A,A

Explanation: In both stories, the main character initially tries to scare off the threat (lion or beggar) by shouting, but this only attracts more attention. They then offer something valuable as a distraction to escape. However, in Story A, the threat is a thief who took the money, while in Story B, the threat is a beggar who was not initially a thief but became one after receiving the money. The key difference is that in Story A, the beggar was not the original threat, but in Story B, the beggar became a threat after receiving the money. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story as it follows the same sequence of events more closely: the main character initially encounters a non-threatening figure who later becomes a threat due to the main character's actions.</s>",,A,B

Explanation: In both stories, there is a leader figure (Mark in the source story and Linda in the comparison stories) who is being attacked or pestered by the group they lead (chickens in the source story and girl scouts in the comparison stories) while they are trying to solve a problem. However, in Story A, the reason for the group's behavior is due to their own distress and uncertainty, while in Story B, the group's behavior is simply pestering their leader with questions. The source story has the chickens attacking Mark for an unknown reason, which is more similar to the girl scouts' behavior in Story A due to their own concerns and uncertainty, rather than the girl scouts' behavior in Story B where they are simply pestering their leader with questions.</s>",,A,B

Explanation: In both stories, a character (Mrs. Jackson in the source story and McGhee in the comparison stories) becomes angry and decides to take revenge due to a perceived injustice. In Story A, the injustice is the principal's decision to increase his own salary while denying the teachers a raise. McGhee's response is to set fire to the principal's office. In Story B, the injustice is the captain's decision to take a vacation while leaving the crew to repair the ship. McGhee's response is to attempt to blow up the captain's cabin. The key similarity between the two stories is the motivation for revenge based on a perceived injustice. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story as it more closely mirrors the sequence of events: the injustice leads to the desire for revenge, which leads to the violent act. In Story B, the sequence of events is reversed, with the violent act preceding the injustice.</s>",,A,A

2. The young person reacts in fear and strikes out, causing harm to the authority figure.
3. The authority figure, instead of retaliating, tries to take the young person away to teach them a lesson.
4. Due to the young person's actions, both the young person and the authority figure end up in a dangerous situation and perish.

Story B shares some similarities with the source story, but the key difference is that in Story B, it's the policeman who initiates the violence by grabbing Gene, whereas in the source story, it's the cobra (Pierre) who strikes first. This makes Story A more analogous to the source story.</s>",,A,B
