Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories.

**Source Story:**

* William is a patient in a psychiatric hospital who is confined indoors.
* He hates the monthly room inspections and spends most of his time daydreaming about food.
* He is motivated by the promise of gingerbread from the cookie shop, but fails to clean his room in time and doesn't get the gingerbread.
* He sulks and slams his door in frustration.

**Story A:**

* Karen always did poorly in high school and despises it.
* She spends most of her time daydreaming about going to Hawaii.
* She is motivated by the promise of a trip to Hawaii, but fails to do well enough in her classes and doesn't get to go.
* She is not mentioned to be sulking or slamming doors.

**Story B:**

* Karen dislikes high school and has trouble getting passing grades.
* She spends most of her time daydreaming about Hawaii and preparing for her trip.
* She fails to graduate and doesn't get to go to Hawaii.

After analyzing the stories, I think **Story A** is more analogous to the source story. Here's why:

* Both William and Karen are motivated by a promise (gingerbread and a trip to Hawaii, respectively) but fail to achieve their goal.
* Both stories feature a character who is unhappy with their situation (William hates the room inspections, Karen despises high school) and spends most of their time daydreaming.
* Both stories have a similar outcome, where the character fails to achieve their goal and is left disappointed.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories.

**Source Story:**

* Mr. Newton, a company manager, uses a new razor made with a metal that stays sharper than before.
* He cuts his neck severely and the inventor recommends a safety feature.
* Mr. Newton considers the safety feature necessary and starts producing it immediately.

**Story A:**

* Ms. Boyce, a company employee, uses a new heat lamp with a filament that produces more intense heat.
* She is seriously burned and the supplier recommends a warning label.
* Ms. Boyce considers the labels necessary and has them printed immediately.

**Story B:**

* She is seriously burned, but initially considers the warning labels unnecessary.
* After the accident, she is frightened and has the warning labels printed immediately.

* Both Story A and Story B involve a company employee using a new product and getting injured.
* Both stories involve the recommendation of a safety feature (warning label) by the supplier.
* Both stories involve the employee considering the safety feature necessary after the accident.

However, there is a key difference between the two stories:

* In Story A, Ms. Boyce considers the warning labels necessary from the start, whereas in Story B, she initially considers them unnecessary.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories.

**Source Story:**

* Mr. Newton, a company manager, uses a new razor made with a metal that stays sharper than before.
* He cuts his neck severely and the inventor recommends a safety feature to prevent similar incidents.
* Mr. Newton considers the safety feature necessary and starts producing it immediately.

**Story A:**

* Ms. Boyce, a company employee, uses a new heat lamp with a filament that produces more intense heat than before.
* She is seriously burned and later, the supplier recommends a warning label to prevent similar incidents.
* Ms. Boyce considers the labels necessary and has them printed immediately after the accident.

**Story B:**

* Ms. Boyce, a company employee, uses a new heat lamp with a filament that produces more intense heat than before.
* She is seriously burned and the supplier recommends a warning label to prevent similar incidents.
* Ms. Boyce considers the labels necessary and has them printed immediately after the accident.

Comparing the three stories, I notice that:

* Both Story A and Story B have a similar sequence of events: an employee uses a new product, gets injured, and the supplier recommends a safety feature.
* The main difference is that in Story A, Ms. Boyce initially considers the warning labels unnecessary, while in Story B, she doesn't have this initial hesitation.

Based on this analysis, I think **Story A** is more analogous to the source story. The source story also has a similar sequence of events, where Mr. Newton initially doesn't consider the safety feature necessary, but later changes his mind after the incident.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories.

**Source Story:**
Joseph, a millionaire, hires a chauffeur to drive his Rolls-Royce. He brags to his wife that he'll never be late for conferences with a chauffeur. However, the chauffeur is asleep one morning, and Joseph is late for a conference. To avoid this, Joseph hires a second chauffeur, which becomes expensive.

**Story A:**
Alexander, a man, lives with his wife and boasts to a friend that he'll always eat well with her at home. However, his wife thinks he'll eat elsewhere and only prepares for herself and their baby. Alexander goes without dinner. To avoid this, Alexander marries a second wife.

**Story B:**
Alexander, a man, has two wives living in two houses. He boasts to a friend that he'll always eat well with both wives. However, his first wife only prepares for herself and their baby, thinking Alexander will eat with his second wife. Alexander then goes to his second wife, but she's already finished eating, thinking he's eating with his first wife. Alexander goes without dinner.

Now, let's compare the stories:

* Both stories have a character (Joseph/Alexander) who makes a boast or claim about their situation.
* Both stories have a situation where the character's expectation is not met (Joseph's chauffeur is asleep, Alexander's wife doesn't prepare dinner).
* Both stories have a consequence (Joseph is late, Alexander goes without dinner).
* Both stories have a solution or attempt to solve the problem (Joseph hires a second chauffeur, Alexander marries a second wife).

However, there are some differences:

* Story A focuses on the character's boast and the consequence of going without dinner, while Story B adds an extra layer of complexity with the two wives and the character's attempts to eat with both.
* Story B is more analogous to the source story in terms of the character's boast and the consequence of not meeting their expectation. The addition of the two wives adds a new layer of complexity, but it's still a similar theme.

Based on this analysis, I would say that **<ans> B </ans>** is more analogous to the source story.",,B,A

**Story A:**

However, when he's hungry, he finds that his wife has only prepared enough food for herself and their baby, thinking he'll be eating elsewhere. Alexander goes without dinner. To avoid this, Alexander marries a second wife.

Now, let's compare the stories:

* Both stories have the character trying to solve the problem (hiring a second chauffeur/marrying a second wife).

However, there's a key difference:

* In the source story, Joseph hires a second chauffeur, which becomes expensive. In Story A, Alexander doesn't hire a second wife; he simply goes without dinner.
* In Story B, Alexander does marry a second wife to avoid going hungry again, similar to Joseph hiring a second chauffeur.

Karla, an old hawk, lived at the top of a tall oak tree. One afternoon, she saw a hunter on the ground with a bow and some crude arrows that had no feathers. The hunter took aim and shot at the hawk but missed. Karla knew the hunter wanted her feathers so she glided down to the hunter and offered to give him a few. The hunter was so grateful that he pledged never to shoot at a hawk again. He went off and shot deer instead.

# Story A:
Once there was a small country called Zerdia that learned to make the world's smartest computer. One day Zerdia was attacked by its warlike neighbor, Gagrach. But the missiles were badly aimed and the attack failed. The Zerdian government realized that Gagrach wanted Zerdian computers so it offered to sell some of its computers to the country. The government of Gagrach was very pleased. It promised never to attack Zerdia again.

# Story B:
Once there was a small country called Zerdia that learned to make the world's smartest computer. Zerdia sold one of itssupercomputers to its neighbor, Gagrach, so Gagrach would promise never to attack Zerdia. But one day Zerdia was overwhelmed by a surprise attack from Gagrach.

Final answer should be in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories.

The source story is about Karla, a hawk, who is attacked by a hunter but manages to avoid harm by offering to give him some of her feathers. The hunter is grateful and pledges to never shoot at a hawk again.

Now, let's look at Story A:

* In this story, Zerdia is attacked by Gagrach, but the attack fails.
* Zerdia offers to sell some of its computers to Gagrach, and Gagrach promises to never attack Zerdia again.

The key similarity between the source story and Story A is that both involve an attacker (hunter/human) who is thwarted and then becomes friendly towards the attacked party (hawk/Zerdia) after a compromise is reached.

On the other hand, Story B is about Zerdia selling a supercomputer to Gagrach, but the attack still occurs, and Zerdia realizes that the attacker's missiles were guided by Zerdian supercomputers. This story does not have the same compromise and friendly resolution as the source story and Story A.

Therefore, I believe the correct answer is:

<ans> A </ans>",,A,A

In the source story, Karla, the hawk, is threatened by a hunter who wants her feathers. Karla offers to give the hunter some feathers, and the hunter is so grateful that he pledges never to shoot at a hawk again.

In Story A, Zerdia, a small country, sells a supercomputer to its neighbor Gagrach, and Gagrach promises not to attack Zerdia. However, Gagrach later attacks Zerdia, and it's revealed that the missiles were guided by Zerdian supercomputers.

In Story B, Zerdia is attacked by Gagrach, but the attack fails because the missiles are badly aimed. Zerdia then offers to sell some of its computers to Gagrach, and Gagrach promises never to attack Zerdia again.

Comparing the three stories, I notice that Story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, a threatened party (Karla the hawk or Zerdia) offers to give something to the threatening party (the hunter or Gagrach) in exchange for peace. The threatening party is grateful and promises to never threaten again.

The source story is about Peter, a young man from Iceland who moves to Florida and tries to get a tan to fit in, but ends up with severe sunburn and decides to leave Florida.

Story A is about Quiggly Company, a small company that tries to get into the integrated circuit market by building a space factory, but ends up losing money and decides to pull out of the market.

Story B is about Quiggly Company, a small company that starts producing integrated circuits and considers entering the space manufacturing market, but is warned by analysts that it's too expensive and competitive, and decides to stick with conventional electrical components.

Now, let's look for similarities between the source story and the comparison stories.

* Both the source story and Story A involve a character (Peter/Quiggly Company) trying to fit in or be competitive in a new environment (Florida/integrated circuit market), but ultimately failing and deciding to leave or change course.
* Both the source story and Story B involve a character (Peter/Quiggly Company) being warned about the dangers or risks of a particular path (getting a tan/space manufacturing), but ignoring the warning and suffering the consequences.

Based on these similarities, I would say that Story A is more analogous to the source story.

The source story is about Percy the mockingbird, who sings for a squirrel in exchange for sunflower seeds. However, the squirrel is disappointed with his singing and refuses to give him the seeds. As a result, Percy vows to give up singing for good.

Now, let's look at the two comparison stories.

Story A and Story B both involve Sam visiting his mother and giving her a gift he bought while traveling. However, there are some key differences.

In Story A, Sam's mother is not pleased with him because he has been wasting his time, and she is not willing to give him a loan. This is similar to the source story, where Percy's singing is not appreciated by the squirrel, and he is not rewarded with sunflower seeds.

In Story B, Sam's mother is not pleased with the gift he gave her, calling it a ""piece of junk."" This is different from the source story, where Percy's singing is not the issue, but rather the squirrel's disappointment with it.

Based on this analysis, I think Story A is more analogous to the source story. Both stories involve someone giving something of value (Percy's singing, Sam's gift) in exchange for something else, but the recipient is not pleased and refuses to reciprocate.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's break down the source story and the two comparison stories.

**Source Story:**

* A dog named Leonard loses a steak and then tries to take another dog's steak, but ends up losing a tooth in the process.

**Story A:**

* Charlie loses an expensive pocket watch and then tries to take another man's watch, but ends up facing a policeman.

**Story B:**

* Charlie sees another man with an expensive watch and, thinking it's the other man's watch, tries to take it, but ends up dropping his own watch and both watches shatter on the floor.

Comparing the three stories, I notice that:

* In the source story, Leonard loses something (a steak) and then tries to take something else (another dog's steak), but ends up losing something else (a tooth).
* In Story A, Charlie loses something (a watch) and then tries to take something else (another man's watch), but ends up facing a policeman.
* In Story B, Charlie tries to take something (another man's watch) but ends up losing something (his own watch) and both watches shatter on the floor.

Based on these similarities, I think **Story B** is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, the main character tries to take something they don't have, but ends up losing something else in the process.

Therefore, my answer is:

<ans> B </ans>",,B,A

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories.

The source story is about Boris and Ivan opening a store together, and Ivan's absent-mindedness causing a problem (throwing out a large amount of cash). However, Ivan redeems himself by selling his stereo set to replace the lost cash.

Story A is about John and Christine getting married, and Christine accidentally denting John's new car. John is upset and insists that Christine never drive his car again.

Story B is also about John and Christine getting married, but with a twist. John discovers that Christine is a reckless driver, so he insists that she never drive his new car. Christine is upset and dents John's new car in retaliation.

Comparing the three stories, I notice that:

* In the source story, Ivan's absent-mindedness causes a problem, but he redeems himself by selling his stereo set.
* In Story A, Christine's reckless behavior causes a problem (denting John's car), but there is no redemption or attempt to make up for it.
* In Story B, Christine's reckless behavior is discovered by John, and she responds by denting his car in retaliation. This shows a similar pattern of behavior to Ivan in the source story, where Ivan's absent-mindedness causes a problem, but he later makes up for it.

Based on this analysis, I think Story B is more analogous to the source story. Both stories feature a character who causes a problem due to their behavior (Ivan's absent-mindedness, Christine's recklessness), but the character later makes up for it (Ivan selling his stereo set, Christine denting John's car in retaliation).

Therefore, my answer is:

<ans> B </ans>",,B,A

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories.

The source story is about Boris and Ivan opening a store together, with Ivan being absent-minded and losing a large amount of cash. Boris is annoyed and demands that Ivan have no involvement in the store's monetary matters. However, Ivan redeems himself by selling his stereo set to replace the lost cash.

Now, let's look at the two comparison stories:

Story A is about John and Christine getting married, with Christine being a reckless driver. John is upset and insists that Christine never drive his new car. However, there is no mention of Christine intentionally damaging the car.

Story B is also about John and Christine getting married, with Christine being reckless and accidentally denting John's new car. John is upset and insists that Christine never drive his car again.

Comparing the two stories, we can see that Story B is more analogous to the source story. Both stories involve a character being careless and causing a problem, which leads to the other character taking action to prevent a similar problem from happening again. In both stories, the careless character redeems themselves in some way (Ivan sells his stereo set, Christine apologizes and promises to be more careful).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

* In both stories, the person who takes advantage of the situation (Moreland) is eventually caught or overpowered by the mean person (Chad).
* In both stories, the mean person (Chad) robs both of the other two people.

He paid Beedle very well and had the tree moved to his own grounds. Fortunately, as soon as it was transplanted, the tree bore delicious apricots again. That very year, the fruit won first prize in the county fair.

# Story A:
Mr. Gerson had several pets but he valued the canary above all the rest. Occasionally, he invited friends over to hear the canary sing.
 A wealthy businessman liked the canary's songs so much that one autumn he decided he wanted the bird in his house in the city where he could enjoy it every day. He paid Mr. Gerson very well and had the canary moved to his house.
 However, upon being moved the canary became fatally ill and there were no more of its beautiful songs. Everyone was extremely disappointed.

# Story B:
Mr. Gerson had several pets but he valued the canary above all the rest. Occasionally, he invited friends over to hear the canary sing. 
 However, one autumn the canary became very ill and there were no more of its beautiful songs. Everyone was extremely disappointed. 
 A veterinarian friend had liked the canary's songs so much that he decided he would buy the canary and put it in his office where he could look after it. He paid Mr. Gerson very well. Upon being moved, the canary sang beautiful songs again.

# Answer:
Final answer should be in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories.

**Source Story:**

* A farmer, Beedle, has a valuable apricot tree that he gives presents from to everyone he knows.
* The tree withers and loses its fruit, causing everyone to be unhappy.
* A judge takes the tree to his own garden, pays Beedle well, and the tree produces delicious apricots again, winning a prize at the county fair.

**Story A:**

* Mr. Gerson has a valued canary that he invites friends to hear sing.
* A wealthy businessman buys the canary, pays Mr. Gerson well, and moves it to his city house.
* However, the canary becomes fatally ill and there are no more beautiful songs.

**Story B:**

* Mr. Gerson has a valued canary that he invites friends to hear sing.
* A veterinarian friend buys the canary, pays Mr. Gerson well, and moves it to his office.
* The canary recovers and sings beautiful songs again.

Now, let's compare the stories:

* Both stories have a valued pet (apricot tree/canary) that is taken away from the original owner.
* Both stories have a new owner who pays well for the pet.
* However, the outcome is different: Story A has a fatal outcome, while Story B has a successful recovery.

Based on these similarities and differences, I think **Story B** is more analogous to the source story. The judge in the source story takes the apricot tree to his own garden and it produces delicious apricots again, similar to the veterinarian friend in Story B who buys the canary and helps it recover.

Therefore, my answer is:

<ans> B </ans>",,B,B

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories.

**Source Story:**
Morris, a simple-minded prisoner, is told by his cellmate to play the harmonica only during the day. He escapes and hides in a boxcar, but then starts playing the harmonica again because he thinks his cellmate said he should play every day. He gets caught and regrets listening to his cellmate.

**Story A:**
Jenny, a little girl, is told by her neighbor to play with her dog only in her own yard. She sneaks out to play with her dog in the neighbor's yard, but then goes home to play with her dog again because she thinks her neighbor said she should play every day. She gets caught and regrets listening to her neighbor.

**Story B:**
Jenny, a little girl, is told by her neighbor to play with her dog only in her own yard. She refuses to listen because she thinks it's bad luck to play in her own yard. She gets caught playing in the neighbor's yard and is made to go to work.

After analyzing the stories, I think **Story A** is more analogous to the source story. Both stories feature a character who is told to do something, but then does the opposite because they misinterpret the instruction. Both characters get caught and regret their actions.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories.

The source story is about Morris, a simple-minded prisoner who escapes from prison and gets caught again because he follows his cellmate's advice to play the harmonica every day. Morris's mistake is that he takes his cellmate's advice too literally and plays the harmonica at night, which leads to his recapture.

Now, let's look at the two comparison stories:

Story A: Jenny, a little girl, wants to play with her dog in her neighbor's yard, but her neighbor tells her to play in her own yard. Jenny refuses to listen and thinks it's bad luck to play in her own yard. She gets caught by her mother when she plays in her neighbor's yard again.

Story B: Jenny, a little girl, loves to play with her dog in her neighbor's yard, but her neighbor tells her to play with her dog in her own yard. A few days later, Jenny sneaks out of the house without doing her chores and hides at the playground. She goes home to play with her dog because she thinks her neighbor said she should play with her dog every day. She gets caught by her mother.

After analyzing the stories, I think Story B is more analogous to the source story. Both stories feature a character who takes someone's advice too literally and gets into trouble as a result. In both stories, the character's mistake is that they follow the advice without considering the context or the intended meaning.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories.

**Source Story:**
King Otto is a warmonger who prioritizes conquest and riches over domestic matters. He rebuilds bridges to support his armies, but his counselor advises him to focus on military campaigns instead. Otto abandons the bridge project and launches an invasion, but later, his carriage crashes through an unfinished bridge, injuring him. This incident makes him realize the importance of balancing military and domestic expenditures.

**Story A:**
Cornelius is an astronomer who neglects his home maintenance, causing the roof to leak. His wife Agatha complains, but Cornelius doesn't listen. Later, a rotten floor collapses, injuring Cornelius, and he realizes he should balance his time between astronomy and home maintenance.

**Story B:**
Cornelius is an astronomer who renovates his home into an observatory. His wife Agatha complains that he's neglecting his job, and the house becomes unlivable. Cornelius decides to focus on astronomy again. Later, an unfinished floor collapses, injuring Cornelius, and he realizes he should balance his time between astronomy and home maintenance.

Now, let's compare the stories:

* Both Story A and Story B feature an astronomer who neglects his home maintenance, leading to an accident that injures him and makes him realize the importance of balance.
* However, Story A focuses more on the consequences of neglecting home maintenance, while Story B emphasizes the consequences of prioritizing one aspect of life (astronomy) over another (home maintenance).

Based on this analysis, I believe that **Story A** is more analogous to the source story. Both stories feature a character who prioritizes one aspect of life over another, leading to negative consequences, and ultimately, a realization of the importance of balance.

* Frederick, a shepherd, is tending his flock when a lion appears.
* Frederick tries to scare the lion away with shouting, but it attracts the lion's attention.
* Frederick gives the lion a lamb to distract it and escapes with the rest of the flock.
* While resting, Frederick realizes another lamb is missing.
* He buys a blunderbuss to defend his flock better in the future.

**Story A:**

* Zebediah, an old miser, is counting his money when a beggar appears.
* Zebediah tries to scare the beggar away with yelling, but it attracts the beggar's attention.
* Zebediah throws a bag of coins to distract the beggar and escapes with the rest of his money.
* While resting, Zebediah realizes another bag of coins is missing.

**Story B:**

* Zebediah, an old miser, is counting his money and dozes off.
* He wakes up to find one bag of coins missing.
* Zebediah yells for the thief to show his face, and a beggar appears.
* Zebediah throws a second bag of coins to distract the beggar and escapes with the rest of his money.

Now, let's compare the stories:

* Both Story A and Story B have a similar structure to the source story: a character is threatened, tries to scare the threat away, and then gives something up to distract the threat and escape.
* However, the key difference is that in the source story, Frederick gives up a lamb to distract the lion, while in both comparison stories, Zebediah gives up money to distract the beggar.
* Story A is more analogous to the source story because it follows a similar pattern of trying to scare the threat away, giving something up to distract it, and then escaping. In Story B, Zebediah doesn't initially try to scare the beggar away, and the beggar appears after Zebediah has already lost one bag of coins.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

But the shouting did nothing but attract the lion's attention and it began walking towards him. He then realized he should have left it alone. 
 To escape, Frederick gave the lion a lamb. While the lion was occupied, he led the rest of the flock away. Eventually, he guessed they were far enough away to be safe from the lion. So he took a nap on the grass.
 However, when he awoke he notice another lamb was missing and he could not find it anywhere! At the next opportunity, Frederick bought a blunderbuss so he could better defend his flock in the future.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's break down the source story and the two comparison stories.

**Source Story:**

1. Frederick is tending his flock when a lion appears.
2. Frederick tries to scare the lion away, but it doesn't work.
3. Frederick gives the lion a lamb to distract it and escapes with the rest of the flock.
4. Frederick takes a nap, but when he wakes up, he realizes another lamb is missing.
5. Frederick buys a blunderbuss to defend his flock better in the future.

**Story A:**

1. Zebediah is sitting on his porch counting his money and dozes off.
2. Zebediah discovers a bag of coins is missing and starts yelling for the thief to show their face.
3. A beggar appears, and Zebediah is frightened.
4. Zebediah throws a second bag of coins to distract the beggar and escapes with the remaining money.
5. Zebediah takes the last few bags of money into the house and locks the door.

**Story B:**

1. Zebediah is sitting on his porch counting his money when a beggar appears.
2. Zebediah is frightened and starts yelling for the beggar to go away.
3. The beggar is attracted to the yelling and approaches Zebediah.
4. Zebediah throws a bag of coins to distract the beggar and escapes with the remaining money.
5. Zebediah takes the last few bags of money into the house and locks the door. When he wakes up, he discovers another bag of coins is missing.

Now, let's compare the stories:

* Both stories have a protagonist who is frightened and tries to distract the ""attacker"" (lion or beggar) to escape.
* Both stories involve the protagonist giving away something valuable (lamb or coins) to distract the attacker.
* Both stories have the protagonist taking the remaining valuables and securing themselves in a safe location.

However, there is a key difference between the two stories:

* In the source story, Frederick gives away a lamb to distract the lion, and then takes a nap, only to discover another lamb is missing. This suggests that the lion may have taken the lamb while Frederick was sleeping.
* In both comparison stories, Zebediah throws away coins to distract the beggar and then takes the remaining money into the house, only to discover another bag of coins is missing. This suggests that the beggar may have taken the coins while Zebediah was sleeping.

Based on this analysis, I believe that **Story B** is more analogous to the source story.",<ans> B </ans>,B,B

* The scouts attack Linda, asking what they will do and where they will sleep.
* Linda screams and runs down the road.

After analyzing the three stories, I think **Story B** is more analogous to the source story. Here's why:

* Both stories have a sudden and unexpected event (chickens attacking Mark, tidal wave hitting the camp) that sets off a chain of events.
* In both stories, the main character (Mark/Linda) is overwhelmed and frustrated by the situation.
* Both stories feature a secondary event (thief stealing eggs, scouts attacking Linda) that occurs while the main character is dealing with the initial crisis.
* Both stories have a sense of chaos and disorder, with the main character trying to regain control of the situation.

* In both stories, the main character is frustrated and runs away, screaming at the group to show some appreciation.

**Differences:**

* In Story A, the girl scouts attack Linda because their sleeping bags were washed away by a tidal wave. In the source story, the chickens attack Mark for unknown reasons.

**Story B:**
McGhee, a sailor, tries to blow up the captain's cabin using dynamite because he's impatient. Later, the captain announces he's taking a vacation, and everyone else must stay on board to repair the ship.

Now, let's compare the stories:

* Both stories have a character (Mrs. Jackson/McGhee) who is dissatisfied with a situation (no salary increase/no vacation).
* Both stories have a trigger event (principal's salary increase/captain's vacation announcement) that leads to the character's anger or upset.
* Both stories have a revenge action (setting fire to the office/blowing up the cabin).

However, there's a key difference:

* In the source story, Mrs. Jackson's anger and revenge are directly caused by the principal's announcement and perceived unfairness. In contrast, McGhee's actions in Story B are not directly caused by the captain's announcement, but rather by his own impatience.

Let's think step by step.
","Let's break down the source story and the two comparison stories to identify the most analogous one.

**Source Story:**

* A cobra (Pierre) is frightened and strikes a falcon, wounding it.
* The falcon grabs the cobra and flies away with it.
* The falcon becomes too weak to fly, and they plummet to the ground, perishing.
* They land in the middle of an outdoor wedding ceremony.

**Story A:**

* Young Gene is walking home from school when a policeman approaches him.
* Gene panics and hits the policeman in the side of the head.
* The policeman grabs Gene and drives away with him.
* The policeman becomes too dizzy to drive, and they run off the road, dying.

**Story B:**

* Young Gene is walking home from school when he meets a policeman.
* The policeman grabs Gene and drives away with him.
* Gene panics and hits the policeman in the side of the head.
* The policeman becomes too dizzy to drive, and they run off the road, dying.

Now, let's compare the stories:

* Both stories A and B have a similar sequence of events: a person (Gene) is grabbed by a authority figure (policeman), panics, and causes harm to the authority figure, leading to a fatal accident.
* The key difference is the order of events in Story B, where the policeman grabs Gene first, and Gene panics and hits the policeman later.

Based on this analysis, I believe that **Story B** is more analogous to the source story. The events in Story B follow a similar sequence and have a similar cause-and-effect chain as the source story.

Therefore, my answer is:

<ans> B </ans>",,B,A

Let's think step by step.
","Let's break down the source story and the two comparison stories.

**Source Story:**

* A cobra (Pierre) and a falcon have an encounter, resulting in the falcon being wounded.
* The falcon grabs the cobra and flies away, but eventually becomes too weak to fly and they both plummet to their death.
* They land in the middle of an outdoor wedding ceremony.

**Story A:**

* Young Gene meets a policeman and is grabbed by the policeman, who drives away with him.
* Gene panics and hits the policeman in the side of the head.
* The policeman becomes too dizzy to drive and they run off the road, dying when they hit a wall.

**Story B:**

* Young Gene meets a policeman and panics, hitting the policeman in the side of the head.
* The policeman grabs Gene and drives away with him.
* The policeman becomes too dizzy to drive and they run off the road, dying when they hit a wall.

Comparing the three stories, I notice that:

* In all three stories, there is an encounter between two individuals (Pierre and the falcon, Gene and the policeman).
* In all three stories, one of the individuals becomes injured or incapacitated (the falcon, the policeman).
* In all three stories, the injured individual's actions lead to a fatal outcome (the falcon and cobra plummeting to their death, Gene and the policeman dying in a car crash).

However, there is one key difference between Story A and Story B:

* In Story A, the policeman grabs Gene before Gene hits the policeman, whereas in Story B, Gene hits the policeman first and then the policeman grabs him.

Given this difference, I believe that **Story B** is more analogous to the source story.",<ans> B </ans>,B,B
