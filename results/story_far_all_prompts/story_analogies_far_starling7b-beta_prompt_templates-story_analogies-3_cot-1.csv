Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the key elements of the source story:

1. The protagonist (William) is in a confined environment (psychiatric hospital).
2. The protagonist dislikes a certain aspect of this environment (monthly room inspections).
3. The protagonist has a strong desire (daydreaming about food).
4. An incentive is offered (gingerbread from the cookie shop) to motivate the protagonist to change his behavior (cleaning his room).
5. Despite the incentive, the protagonist fails to meet the requirement (cleaning his room) and does not receive the reward (gingerbread).

Now, let's analyze the key elements of story A:

1. The protagonist (Karen) dislikes her current situation (high school).
2. The protagonist has a strong desire (going to Hawaii).
3. An incentive is offered (trip to Hawaii) to motivate the protagonist to improve her performance in school.
4. Despite the incentive, the protagonist fails to meet the requirement (improving her grades) and does not receive the reward (trip to Hawaii).

And now, let's analyze the key elements of story B:

1. The protagonist (Karen) dislikes her current situation (high school).
2. The protagonist has a strong desire (going to Hawaii).
3. An incentive is offered (trip to Hawaii) to motivate the protagonist to improve her performance in school.
4. Despite the incentive, the protagonist fails to meet the requirement (improving her grades) and does not receive the reward (trip to Hawaii).

Comparing the key elements of the source story with those of stories A and B, we can see that story A is more analogous to the source story. Both stories involve a protagonist who dislikes their current situation, has a strong desire, and is offered an incentive to change their behavior. However, in both stories, the protagonist fails to meet the requirement and does not receive the reward.

1. The protagonist (William) is in a psychiatric hospital and struggles with keeping his room clean.
2. The nurse promises him a reward (gingerbread) if he cleans his room.

4. Ms. Boyce initially considers the labels unnecessary but changes her mind after getting seriously burned while using one of these new heat lamps.
5. She has the warning labels printed immediately.

Comparing the stories, we can see that Story A is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, a new product (razor in the source story and heat lamp in Story A) is developed with improved performance but poses a risk of injury. In both cases, an incident involving the person in charge (Mr. Newton and Ms. Boyce) leads to the recommendation of a safety feature (safety razor and warning label), which they then consider necessary and implement immediately.

Comparing the stories, we can see that both A and B have the following similarities with the source story:

1. A character (Mr. Newton in the source story, Ms. Boyce in stories A and B) experiences a severe injury due to a new product.
2. The injury leads to the recommendation of a safety feature or warning label.
3. The character who experienced the injury considers the safety feature or warning label necessary and takes immediate action to implement it.

Therefore, both stories A and B are analogous to the source story. However, if we have to choose only one, story A is slightly more analogous because it follows the same sequence of events as the source story: the injury occurs before the recommendation of the safety feature, and the character's change of mind happens after the incident.

- He brags about never being late for conferences due to the chauffeur.
- One morning, the chauffeur is asleep, and Joseph is late for his conference.
- Joseph hires a second chauffeur to prevent future lateness.

Story A:
- Alexander lives with his wife and boasts about always having a good meal.
- One day, he comes home hungry, but his wife only prepared for herself and their baby.
- Alexander hires a second wife to ensure he always has a meal.

Story B:
- Alexander has two wives in two houses and boasts about always having a good meal.
- One day, he goes to his first wife, but she only prepared for herself and their baby.
- He goes to his second wife, but she already finished eating.
- Alexander goes without dinner.

Now, let's compare the stories to the source story.

Story A is analogous to the source story because both involve a character who makes a claim about their situation (Joseph about his punctuality, Alexander about his meals) and faces a situation where their claim is not fulfilled (Joseph's chauffeur is asleep, Alexander's wife only prepared for herself and their baby). In both cases, the characters take action to prevent future issues (Joseph hires a second chauffeur, Alexander marries a second wife).

Story B is not analogous to the source story because it does not involve a character making a claim about their situation or taking action to prevent future issues. Instead, it focuses on a single day where the character faces multiple failures in his plan to have a meal.

Story A is analogous to the source story because both involve a character who makes a boast about having something (a chauffeur in the source story, two wives in Story A) to ensure a certain outcome (never being late for conferences, always having enough food). However, in both cases, the character's plan fails due to miscommunication or misunderstanding, leading to an undesirable outcome (being late for a conference, going without dinner).

Story B is not analogous to the source story because it does not involve a similar boast or plan. Instead, it focuses on the character's reaction to going without dinner by marrying a second wife, which is not related to the source story's theme of making a boast and facing consequences.

The hunter was so grateful that he pledged never to shoot at a hawk again. He went off and shot deer instead.

This is story A:

Once there was a small country called Zerdia that learned to make the world's smartest computer. One day Zerdia was attacked by its warlike neighbor, Gagrach. But the missiles were badly aimed and the attack failed. The Zerdian government realized that Gagrach wanted Zerdian computers so it offered to sell some of its computers to the country. The government of Gagrach was very pleased. It promised never to attack Zerdia again.

This is story B:

Once there was a small country called Zerdia that learned to make the world's smartest computer. Zerdia sold one of itssupercomputers to its neighbor, Gagrach, so Gagrach would promise never to attack Zerdia. But one day Zerdia was overwhelmed by a surprise attack from Gagrach. As it capitulated the crippled government of Zerdia realized that the attacker's missiles had been guided by Zerdian supercomputers.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the source story and the two given stories.

Source Story:
1. Karla, an old hawk, lives at the top of a tall oak tree.
2. A hunter tries to shoot Karla but misses.
3. Karla offers her feathers to the hunter, who is grateful and promises not to shoot hawks again.

Story A:
1. Zerdia creates the world's smartest computer.
2. Gagrach attacks Zerdia, but the attack fails.
3. Zerdia offers to sell computers to Gagrach, who promises not to attack again.

Story B:
1. Zerdia creates the world's smartest computer.
2. Zerdia sells a supercomputer to Gagrach to prevent attacks.
3. Gagrach surprises Zerdia with a missile attack guided by Zerdian supercomputers.

Now, let's compare the stories to the source story:

Story A is analogous to the source story because:
1. Both involve a superior entity (Karla the hawk and Zerdia with the smartest computer) that has something the other party wants (feathers and supercomputer).
2. The superior entity offers what the other party wants, which leads to a promise of non-aggression (hunter not shooting hawks and Gagrach not attacking Zerdia).

Story B is not analogous to the source story because:
1. The outcome in Story B is a surprise attack on Zerdia, which contradicts the promise of non-aggression.
2. The use of Zerdian supercomputers in the attack on Zerdia itself is not consistent with the promise of non-aggression.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> A </ans>

Story A is the one that is most analogous to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,A

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the key elements of the source story:

1. An older, wiser character (Karla the hawk) has something valuable (feathers) that a younger, less experienced character (the hunter) wants.
2. The older character offers to give the younger character what they want, in exchange for a promise not to harm them in the future.
3. The younger character agrees to the exchange and keeps their promise.

Now, let's compare these elements to stories A and B:

In story A, Zerdia has a valuable asset (the world's smartest computer) that Gagrach wants. However, Gagrach attacks Zerdia despite the exchange of the supercomputer, which goes against the promise not to attack. This story does not follow the same pattern as the source story.

In story B, Zerdia's valuable asset (the world's smartest computer) is not directly used for an attack, but rather, Gagrach wants to acquire it. When Zerdia offers to sell the computers, Gagrach agrees not to attack Zerdia in the future. This story aligns more closely with the source story's pattern of exchange and promise-keeping.

Therefore, the final answer is: <ans> B </ans> as story B is more analogous to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the source story and the two given stories.

Source Story: Peter, a young man from Iceland, moves to Florida and tries to get a tan to fit in. He doesn't understand the dangers of sun exposure and ends up with severe sunburns. He decides Florida isn't for him and returns to Iceland.

Story A: Quiggly Company, a small electrical component manufacturer, decides to enter the integrated circuit market and invests heavily in space factories. They don't realize the financial risk involved and end up losing a lot of money, causing their stocks to plummet. They decide to leave the integrated circuit market and return to making conventional electrical components.

Story B: Quiggly Company, a small electrical component manufacturer, starts producing integrated circuits and considers entering the space manufacturing market. Market analysts warn them about the high costs and competitive nature of the market, and Quiggly decides to play it safe by continuing to manufacture conventional electrical components.

Now, let's compare the source story to the two given stories.

In both Story A and the source story, the main characters (Peter and Quiggly Company) take a risk without fully understanding the consequences. In both cases, they end up facing negative outcomes (Peter with severe sunburns, Quiggly with financial losses). As a result, they decide to change their course of action (Peter leaves Florida, Quiggly leaves the integrated circuit market).

In Story B, Quiggly Company decides not to take the risk of entering the space manufacturing market due to the warnings from market analysts. This story does not have the same elements of taking a risk without understanding the consequences and facing negative outcomes.

Based on this analysis, the answer is:

<ans> A </ans>

- Market analysts warn them about the high costs and competitive market.
- Quiggly Company decides to stick with conventional electrical components.

Story B:
- Quiggly Company starts producing integrated circuits and decides to invest in a space factory.
- They don't realize the financial risk and end up losing a lot of money.
- Quiggly Company decides to pull out of integrated circuits and return to conventional electrical components.

Now, let's compare the source story to stories A and B.

In both stories A and B, Quiggly Company is involved in the integrated circuit market and faces challenges due to their decisions. In story A, they are warned about the risks of space manufacturing and decide to avoid it, while in story B, they invest heavily in space manufacturing and face financial ruin.

In the source story, Peter's decision to tan leads to severe consequences (sunburns and hospitalization), and he decides to leave Florida.

Comparing the consequences and decisions in the source story and stories A and B, we can see that story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, the characters make risky decisions based on their perceptions of what others are doing, which leads to negative outcomes.

- She wants to buy them but finds them too expensive.
- She becomes disappointed, then realizes they might be boring even if she could afford them.

Now, let's compare the stories to the source story:

In both Story A and the source story, the characters (Julius and Cindy) find something they want to confirm a prediction about (rotten pears and bad records, respectively). In both cases, they are unable to obtain what they want due to external factors (height and cost), and they become disappointed.

In Story B, while Cindy also finds something she wants and is unable to afford it, the disappointment is resolved differently (by realizing the records might be boring). This story does not fully align with the source story in terms of the characters' reactions to their disappointment.

2. The squirrel was disappointed in Percy's singing and refused to give him seeds.
3. Percy was sad and vowed to give up singing.

Story A:
1. Sam traveled the world, bought beautiful things, and ran out of money.
2. He visited his mother, hoping she would give him a loan.
3. His mother was disappointed in him and refused to give him money.

Story B:
1. Sam traveled the world, bought beautiful things, and ran out of money.
2. He visited his mother, hoping she would give him a loan.
3. His mother was disappointed in him and refused to give him money, calling the gift ""a piece of junk.""

Now, let's compare the stories to the source story:

- In both Story A and Story B, Sam is seeking financial help from his mother after spending money on his travels. This is similar to Percy seeking sunflower seeds from the squirrel in exchange for his singing.
- In both Story A and Story B, the mother/squirrel is disappointed in Sam/Percy and refuses to provide the requested help. This mirrors the disappointment and refusal in the source story.

Based on these similarities, both Story A and Story B are analogous to the source story. However, Story B has a slightly stronger connection due to the additional detail of the mother calling the gift ""a piece of junk,"" which adds an element of criticism similar to the squirrel's disappointment in Percy's singing.

Final answer: <ans> B </ans> is the most analogous to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

","First, let's analyze the source story and the two given stories (A and B) to determine their similarities and differences.

Source Story:
1. Leonard, the dog, drops a steak into the lake and loses his dinner.
2. Leonard sees another dog with a steak and tries to take it, resulting in a tooth loss.

Story A:
1. Charlie drops an expensive pocket watch and loses it.
2. Charlie sees another man with an expensive watch and tries to take it, but the man is a policeman.

Story B:
1. Charlie sees another man with an expensive watch but mistakenly believes it's his reflection.
2. Charlie reaches out to take the watch, dropping his own in the process, and both watches shatter.

Now, let's compare the stories to the source story:

Story A is analogous to the source story because it involves a character (Charlie) losing something valuable (an expensive pocket watch) and then attempting to take something from another person (a policeman) as a result. This leads to a negative outcome for Charlie, similar to Leonard in the source story.

Story B is not analogous to the source story because it involves a character (Charlie) mistakenly believing he sees his own reflection in another person's watch and accidentally dropping his own watch, rather than intentionally trying to take something from another person.

Therefore, the final answer is: <ans> A </ans>

Story A has some similarities with the source story, such as the character seeing something they want and attempting to take it, leading to the loss of their own item. However, the source story involves a physical altercation (the dog fight), while Story A involves a misunderstanding (Charlie thinking the other watch is his reflection).

Story B has some similarities with the source story as well, such as the character losing their own item (the pocket watch) and attempting to take another item. However, the source story involves a physical altercation (the dog fight), while Story B involves a legal consequence (the policeman).

Story A: John and Christine love each other and decide to get married. Christine accidentally dents John's new car, which upsets John. He insists that she never drive his car again.

Story B: John and Christine love each other and decide to get married. John discovers that Christine is a reckless driver, so he insists that she never drive his new car. This upsets Christine, and she deliberately dents John's new car in an attempt to hurt him.

Comparing the source story to the two given stories, we can see that:

- In both the source story and Story A, there is a mistake or accident that leads to a conflict (Ivan losing cash, Christine denting the car).
- In both the source story and Story A, one character's actions lead to the other character taking control of a situation (Boris demanding Ivan not handle money, John not allowing Christine to drive his car).
- In both the source story and Story A, the characters eventually resolve the conflict or make amends (Ivan selling the stereo set, the story does not specify if the conflict between John and Christine is resolved).

A farmer named Beedle had a choice apricot tree that he valued above all the rest in his garden. Every year Beedle gave presents of fruit from this tree to everyone he knew.
 But one year the tree began to wither and there was no moreof the wonderful fruit. Everyone was very unhappy.
 The judge had enjoyed the apricots from the tree very much -so much so that he resolved to take the tree to his own garden to take care of it. He paid Beedle very well and had the tree moved to his own grounds. Fortunately, as soon as it was transplanted, the tree bore delicious apricots again.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the key elements of the source story:

1. A valued tree (apricot tree) that produces wonderful fruit.
2. The tree withers and stops producing fruit.
3. A judge values the tree and transplants it to his own garden.
4. The tree starts producing fruit again and wins a prize.

Now, let's analyze the key elements of story A:

1. A valued canary that sings beautifully.
2. The canary stops singing due to being moved.
3. A wealthy businessman buys the canary and moves it to his city house.
4. The canary becomes ill and stops singing.

And the key elements of story B:

1. A valued canary that sings beautifully.
2. The canary becomes ill and stops singing.
3. A veterinarian friend buys the canary and moves it to his office.
4. The canary starts singing beautifully again.

Comparing the key elements of the source story with stories A and B, we can see that story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, a valued object (the apricot tree in the source story and the canary in story B) faces a challenge (the tree withers and the canary becomes ill), but is ultimately saved and restored to its former glory by a caring individual (the judge in the source story and the veterinarian in story B).

Therefore, the final answer is: <ans> B </ans>.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

- His counselor complains about the spending and lack of focus on military campaigns.
- Otto abandons the bridge project and invades a neighboring country.
- Otto crashes through an unfinished bridge, gets injured, and realizes he needs to balance military and domestic expenditures.

Story A:
- Cornelius is an astronomer obsessed with astronomy.
- He turns his home into an observatory, neglecting his job as an astronomer.
- His wife complains about the time spent on the house and the lack of focus on astronomy.
- Cornelius goes back to thinking only about astronomy.
- Cornelius falls through an unfinished floor, gets injured, and realizes he should balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.

Story B:
- Cornelius is an astronomer obsessed with stars and galaxies.
- His wife complains about the time spent on astronomy and the lack of focus on maintaining their house.
- The house becomes unlivable due to neglect.
- Cornelius doesn't listen and continues focusing on astronomy.
- Cornelius falls through a rotten floor, gets injured, and realizes his wife was right. He decides to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.

Frederick the shepherd was tending his flock at the edge of a forest. Suddenly, a lion appeared out of the forest. Frederick was really scared so he started shouting to scare the lion away. But the shouting did nothing but attract the lion's attention and it began walking towards him. He then realized he should have left it alone. 
 To escape, Frederick gave the lion a lamb. While the lion was occupied, he led the rest of the flock away. Eventually, he guessed they were far enough away to be safe from the lion. So he took a nap on the grass.
 However, when he awoke he notice another lamb was missing and he could not find it anywhere! At the next opportunity, Frederick bought a blunderbuss so he could better defend his flock in the future.

This is story A:

Zebediah, the old miser, was sitting on his back porch counting his money and he dozed off. When he awoke he discovered that one bag of coins was missing. He could not find the bag anywhere. Zebediah figured that the thief was still nearby so he started yelling for whoever took the money to show his face.
 Suddenly, a beggar came out of the forsythia bushes and started walking towards the old man on the porch. Zebediah was surprised and very frightened. He wished he had left the beggar alone. 
 To escape, he threw a second bag of coins to the beggar. While the beggar was occupied, Zebediah took the last few bags of money into the house and locked the door!

This is story B:

Zebediah, the old miser, was sitting on his back porch counting his money. Suddenly, a beggar came out of the forsythia bushes.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the key elements of the source story:

1. Frederick, the shepherd, is tending his flock near a forest.
2. A lion appears and Frederick tries to scare it away, but fails and gives it a lamb to escape.
3. Frederick later discovers another lamb is missing.
4. Frederick buys a blunderbuss to better defend his flock in the future.

Now, let's compare these elements to stories A and B:

In story A, Zebediah is an old miser who loses a bag of coins while counting them. He encounters a beggar, throws another bag of coins at him to escape, and later discovers another bag of coins missing.

In story B, Zebediah is again an old miser who loses a bag of coins while counting them. He encounters a beggar, throws a bag of coins at him to escape, and later discovers another bag of coins missing.

Comparing these stories to the source story, we can see that:

- In both stories A and B, the main character encounters a threat (lion in the source story, beggar in stories A and B), tries to escape by giving away something valuable (lamb in the source story, bag of coins in stories A and B), and later discovers something else is missing (lamb in the source story, another bag of coins in stories A and B).

Based on these similarities, we can conclude that both stories A and B are analogous to the source story. However, if we have to choose only one, story A is slightly more analogous as it involves a similar situation of encountering a threat and trying to escape by giving away something valuable, followed by the discovery of another missing item.

So, the final answer is: <ans> A </ans>.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,B

2. The unexpected event leads to a negative outcome (chickens chasing him, eggs being stolen).
3. The protagonist reacts emotionally (screaming at the chickens, going to the hospital, quitting farming, going on vacation).

Now, let's analyze the key elements of story A:

1. The protagonist (Linda) is involved in a task (thinking about the camp) when the unexpected event occurs (girl scouts returning and pestering her).
2. The unexpected event leads to a negative outcome (tidal wave washing away sleeping bags).
3. The protagonist reacts emotionally (screaming at the scouts, running away).

And now, let's analyze the key elements of story B:

1. The unexpected event (tidal wave) occurs while the protagonist (Linda) is away.
2. The protagonist discovers the negative outcome (washed away sleeping bags) upon returning.
3. The protagonist reacts emotionally (thinking, running away, being pestered by scouts).

3. An external authority figure (Lee) intervenes and takes the resource for herself.
4. The characters realize their mistake too late, and the resource is lost.

Comparing these stories to the source story, we can see that:

- Story A is more analogous to the source story because it follows the same pattern of characters discovering a valuable resource, arguing over it, having an external authority figure intervene and divide the resource, and learning a lesson from the experience.
- Story B is less analogous because the external authority figure takes the resource for herself instead of dividing it, and the characters miss the opportunity to resolve the situation amicably.

This is story B:

Young Gene was walking home from school when he met a policeman. Suddenly, the policeman grabbed him and drove away with him.
 Once they got onto the freeway, Gene panicked and hit the policeman in the side of the head. Unfortunately, the policeman became too dizzy to drive. Consequently, they ran off the road and died when they hit a wall.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the source story and the two given stories.

Source Story:
1. Pierre (cobra) and the falcon interact, leading to Pierre wounding the falcon.
2. Falcon teaches Pierre a lesson by carrying him away, but they both die in the process.
3. They land in the middle of an outdoor wedding ceremony.

Story A:
1. Gene hits a policeman, panicking.
2. Policeman grabs Gene and drives away, but they both die in a car accident.

Story B:
1. Gene meets a policeman, who grabs him and drives away.
2. Gene panics and hits the policeman, causing them to lose control and die in a car accident.

Now, let's compare the stories to the source story:

- Both Story A and Story B involve a conflict between two characters (Gene and the policeman in Story A, Gene and the falcon in the source story) that leads to their mutual demise.
- Both Story A and Story B involve a car accident or similar incident as the cause of death for the characters.
- Neither Story A nor Story B has a clear parallel to the falcon carrying the cobra away in the source story.

Based on these comparisons, we can conclude that Story A is more analogous to the source story than Story B. Both involve a conflict between two characters that leads to their mutual demise, and both involve a car accident or similar incident as the cause of death.

So, the final answer is: <ans> A </ans>.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,A
35,"A cobra called Pierre was slithering through the brush when a falcon came towards it. Pierre became frightened and struck, wounding the falcon in the abdomen. To teach him a lesson, the falcon grabbed the cobra and flew away with it.
 Unfortunately for both of them, after they were high above the earth the wounded falcon became too weak to fly. Consequently, they plummeted straight down to the earth and perished. They landed, strangely enough, in the middle of an outdoor wedding ceremony.","Young Gene was walking home from school when he met a policeman.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the source story and identify its key elements:

1. Two characters with opposing roles: Pierre (the cobra) and the falcon.
2. An initial conflict: Pierre strikes the falcon out of fear.
3. A consequence of the conflict: The falcon captures Pierre and they both fall to their deaths.
4. The setting: An outdoor wedding ceremony.

Now, let's examine stories A and B to see which one is more analogous to the source story:

Story A:
1. Two characters: Young Gene and a policeman.
2. An initial conflict: Gene hits the policeman in self-defense.
3. A consequence of the conflict: The policeman becomes too dizzy to drive, and they both die in a car accident.
4. The setting: Not specified, but not an outdoor wedding ceremony.

Story B:
1. Two characters: Young Gene and a policeman.
2. An initial conflict: Gene hits the policeman in self-defense.
3. A consequence of the conflict: The policeman becomes too dizzy to drive, and they both die in a car accident.
4. The setting: Not specified, but not an outdoor wedding ceremony.

Comparing the key elements of the source story with stories A and B, we can see that story B is more analogous to the source story. Both stories involve two characters with opposing roles (Pierre and the falcon vs. Gene and the policeman), an initial conflict (Pierre striking the falcon vs. Gene hitting the policeman), and a consequence of the conflict (both pairs falling to their deaths) that results in their demise.

Therefore, the final answer is: <ans> B </ans>.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B
