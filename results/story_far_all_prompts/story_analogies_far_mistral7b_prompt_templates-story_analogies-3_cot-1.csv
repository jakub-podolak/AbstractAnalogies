In both the source story and Story A, the person (William and Karen, respectively) are motivated by the promise of a reward (gingerbread and a trip to Hawaii, respectively) to improve their situation (pass room inspections and graduate from high school, respectively). However, they ultimately fail to achieve their goal and do not receive the reward. The difference in the stories lies in the reason for their failure - in the source story, William fails due to a lack of time, while in Story A, Karen fails due to her previous poor performance.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","Both stories A and B involve a character being frightened by an unexpected intruder (a lion in story A and a beggar in stories A and B) and giving something valuable to the intruder to buy safety. However, in both stories, the character later realizes that the intruder took more than what was given, leading to the loss of more valuables.

Therefore, both stories A and B are analogous to the source story.

However, if we have to choose the most accurate one, then story A is more analogous to the source story as it closely follows the sequence of events in the source story, where the shepherd gives a lamb to the lion and later realizes that another lamb is missing. In contrast, in story B, the order of events is slightly different, as the old miser realizes that a bag of coins is missing before the beggar appears.

Explanation: The reason I marked answer A as the correct one is that in the source story, the threatening figure is a lion, while in story B, it's a beggar.

In story A, Frederick gives a lamb to the lion, while in story B, Zebediah gives bags of coins to the beggar. Both stories follow the same structure as the source story, so they are analogous.

However, in the source story, the disruptive behavior of the chickens directly causes the theft of the eggs by an external thief. In stories A and B, the disruptive behavior of the group only becomes a problem after a larger issue has already occurred.

Therefore, while there are similarities between the stories, they are not exactly analogous to the source story.

However, in the source story, the reason for the chickens' aggression is unknown, while in stories A and B, the reason for the girl scouts' behavior is their anxiety and frustration over the loss of their sleeping bags.

The key difference between the stories is that in the source story, an external factor (the thief) causes the crisis, while in stories A and B, the crisis is an internal issue caused by the group's own behavior.

Therefore, story B is more analogous to the source story as it also involves an unexpected crisis that causes the group to behave aggressively towards their leader, even though the reasons for their behavior are different.

Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?
Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","Both stories involve a person (or animal in the source story) being taken against their will by an authority figure, and then reacting in a way that leads to their demise. In story A, it's the cobra striking the falcon, and in story B, it's Gene hitting the policeman.

However, the key element that makes story A analogous to the source story is that in both cases, the authority figure (falcon and policeman) intended to teach a lesson or set things right, but ultimately ended up causing harm or death to themselves and the other party involved.

In story B, there's no indication that the policeman intended to teach Gene a lesson or set things right before Gene hit him. Therefore, story A is the correct answer.

Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Only one answer is correct.

Let's think step by step.
","Both stories involve a person (or animal in the source story) and a law enforcement figure, and both involve an unexpected turn of events leading to their demise. However, in the source story, it is the cobra (Pierre) that strikes the falcon in self-defense, while in stories A and B, it is Gene who initiates the violence against the policeman.

To find the analogous story, we need to look for the one where the order of events is closest to the source story:

1. In the source story, the cobra (Pierre) strikes first in self-defense.
2. In story A, Gene initiates the violence against the policeman.
3. In story B, the policeman grabs Gene first, similar to the falcon grabbing Pierre in the source story.

Therefore, the answer is: <ans> B </ans>.</s>",,B,B
