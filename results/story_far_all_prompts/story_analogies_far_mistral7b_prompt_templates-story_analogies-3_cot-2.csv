The key similarities between the source story and Story A are:

1. The protagonist (William/Karen) dislikes a particular situation (being confined in a psychiatric hospital/doing poorly in high school).
2. They spend most of their time daydreaming about something else (food/Hawaii).
3. They are given an incentive to improve their situation (gingerbread/trip to Hawaii).
4. They fail to meet the requirement to receive the incentive (room inspection not passed/failed to graduate).
5. They are disappointed and upset as a result (William sulked and slammed his door/Karen did not go to Hawaii).

Story B also shares some similarities, but the key difference is that in Story A, the protagonist's failure to meet the requirement is directly caused by her daydreaming, while in Story B, it is not explicitly stated that her failure was caused by her dislike of school or her daydreaming about Hawaii. Instead, it is mentioned that she ""failed to graduate,"" but it is not clear whether this was due to her lack of effort or other factors. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story.</s>",,A,A

Both stories involve a new product with improved features, an accident that occurs to the person in charge, and a safety feature being recommended as a result. In Story A, the person in charge (Ms. Boyce) initially considers the safety feature unnecessary but changes her mind after experiencing the accident herself. This is similar to what happened in the source story with Mr. Newton and the safety razor. In Story B, on the other hand, the person in charge (Ms. Boyce) does not consider the safety feature necessary at first and does not change her mind until after the accident. This is not analogous to the source story, where Mr. Newton's opinion about the safety feature changes after the accident.</s>",,A,A

In both stories, an invention leads to an accident that causes the person in charge to realize the importance of a safety feature. In Story A, the person in charge initially disregards the safety feature recommendation, but later changes her mind after experiencing the accident herself. In Story B, the person in charge also initially disregards the safety feature recommendation, but later changes her mind after experiencing the accident herself.

Therefore, both stories are analogous to the source story in that they involve an invention leading to an accident and the subsequent realization of the importance of a safety feature. However, Story B is more analogous to the source story because in both stories, the person in charge experiences the accident themselves and then implements the safety feature in response. In Story A, the supplier recommends the warning labels after the accident, but Ms. Boyce initially disregards them and only implements them after her own accident. In contrast, in Story B, the supplier recommends the warning labels in response to Ms. Boyce's accident, and she implements them immediately.

Therefore, Story B is more analogous to the source story because it more closely follows the sequence of events in the source story, where the inventor recommends the safety feature in response to an accident, and the manager implements it immediately after experiencing the same risk.</s>",,B,B

","Both stories involve a man who makes assumptions about where his significant other will prepare a meal for him, leading to him going without a meal. However, the source story is about a millionaire who hires two chauffeurs to drive his Rolls-Royce, while Story A is about a man with two wives.

The key difference lies in the cause of the problem. In the source story, the problem arises due to the millionaire's assumption that one of his chauffeurs would be driving him on a particular day, leading him to be late for his conference and ultimately hungry. In contrast, in Story A, the problem arises due to each wife assuming that Alexander would be eating with the other wife, leading him to go without a meal.

Therefore, based on the given information, Story A is less analogous to the source story as the cause of the problem is different. The source story is about a millionaire and his chauffeurs, while Story A is about a man with two wives. However, the similarity in the outcome (both men going without a meal due to assumptions) does not make them equally analogous.

Let's think step by step.
","In the source story, the hunter wanted Karla's feathers and missed shooting her. Karla then offered her feathers to the hunter, who in turn promised not to shoot at hawks again.

In Story A, Zerdia had the world's smartest computer and Gagrach wanted to acquire it. The attack on Zerdia failed due to poorly aimed missiles. Zerdia then sold some computers to Gagrach, who promised not to attack Zerdia again.

In Story B, Zerdia had the world's smartest computer and sold one to Gagrach to prevent an attack. However, Gagrach later used Zerdian supercomputers to guide its missiles during a surprise attack on Zerdia.

Comparing the stories, we see that in both stories, there is a desirable object (hawk feathers in the source story and Zerdian supercomputers in Story B) that the attacking party (hunter and Gagrach, respectively) wants. In the source story, the hawk offers the hunter the object, and the hunter makes a promise in return. In Story A, Zerdia sells the object to the attacking party, and the attacking party makes a promise in return.

However, in Story B, the situation is different. Zerdia sells the object to the attacking party, but later discovers that the attacking party used the object against Zerdia. This is not the case in the source story, where the hunter keeps his promise and does not use the hawk feathers against hawks.

Based on this analysis, the answer is:

<ans> A </ans>

The reason is that in both stories, there is a transfer of the desirable object from the possessor to the attacking party, followed by a promise from the attacking party. Story B, however, includes an additional element where the attacking party uses the desirable object against the possessor, which is not present in the source story.</s>",,A,A

As it capitulated the crippled government of Zerdia realized that the attacker's missiles had been guided by Zerdian supercomputers.

","In the source story, the hawk (Karla) gives her feathers to the hunter to prevent him from shooting at her again. In Story A, Zerdia sells its supercomputer to Gagrach to prevent an attack, but later discovers that the attacker used its computers to guide missiles against it. In Story B, Zerdia offers to sell its computers to Gagrach after an unsuccessful attack, and Gagrach promises never to attack again.

The key difference between the stories is that in the source story, the hawk gives the hunter something of value to prevent harm, while in Story A, Zerdia sells something of value only after harm has been done and the attacker has used it against them. In Story B, the exchange of value occurs after an unsuccessful attack and a promise of peace.

Based on this analysis, the more analogous story to the source story is Story B, where the exchange of value occurs before any harm is done and prevents future harm.</s>",<ans> B </ans></s>,B,B

Explanation:

Both stories involve a character or entity (Peter and Quiggly Company) taking a risk that ultimately leads to negative consequences. In the source story, Peter's risk was exposing himself to the sun to get a tan, while in Story A, Quiggly Company's risk was entering the space manufacturing market for integrated circuits. In Story B, Quiggly Company's risk was also entering the space manufacturing market for integrated circuits but they went all in by putting all their assets into it.

The key difference between the two comparison stories is the level of commitment to the risk. Peter's risk was a personal one, and while it led to severe consequences, he was able to return to his previous situation (Iceland) relatively easily. Quiggly Company, on the other hand, made a much larger investment in their risk, and the consequences were much more severe and long-lasting. Their decision to pull out and go back to making conventional electrical components was a result of the financial strain caused by their failed investment in space manufacturing.

Therefore, Story B is more analogous to the source story as both involve taking a risk that leads to negative consequences, with the difference being the level of commitment to that risk.</s>",,B,B

","Both stories involve a character desiring an item they cannot afford and experiencing disappointment. However, the key difference lies in their reasoning and attitude towards the item.

In the source story, Julius is initially disappointed because he cannot reach the pears due to their height and his own weakness. He then goes to sleep, dreaming about having an abundance of pears. His disappointment stems from a physical inability to obtain the pears.

In Story A, Cindy is disappointed because she cannot afford the records she wants. However, she also dismisses the value of the records, believing they are probably boring. Her disappointment is due to a financial constraint and her own perception of the records' worth.

In Story B, Cindy is also disappointed because she cannot afford the records she is curious about. Her disappointment is similar to Julius' in that it is due to a financial constraint and her inability to obtain the desired item.

Based on this analysis, the more analogous comparison story to the source story is Story B, as both stories involve a character experiencing disappointment due to a financial constraint and their inability to obtain a desired item.</s>",<ans> B </ans></s>,B,B

Let's think step by step.
","In the source story, Boris and Ivan have a business partnership and there is a misunderstanding over money management due to Ivan's absent-mindedness. In Story A, John and Christine have a personal relationship and there is a misunderstanding over driving privileges due to Christine's recklessness. In Story B, John and Christine have a personal relationship and there is a misunderstanding over driving privileges due to Christine's recklessness, which leads to her damaging John's car in retaliation.

The key difference between the stories is that in the source story, Ivan's mistake with the money was an accident, while in Story B, Christine's reckless driving was a deliberate act of revenge.

Given the information provided, the source story is more analogous to Story A, as both involve misunderstandings and accidents leading to tension in relationships. Story B introduces an element of deliberate harm that is not present in the source story.

Let's think step by step.
","In the source story, Boris and Ivan have a business partnership and there is a misunderstanding about money management leading to a request for Ivan to stay away from financial matters. In Story A, there is a personal relationship between John and Christine, and a driving issue leads to a request for Christine to stay away from John's car. In Story B, there is also a personal relationship between John and Christine, and an accidental incident leads to a request for Christine to stay away from John's car.

The key difference between the stories is the cause of the request for the person to stay away from a financial or physical asset. In the source story, the cause is a misunderstanding and a request for Ivan to not handle money due to his absent-mindedness. In Story A, the cause is a reckless action by Christine that damages John's car. In Story B, the cause is also a reckless action by Christine, but this time it is an accidental incident that damages John's car.

Given this analysis, Story A is less analogous to the source story because the cause of the request for the person to stay away from a financial or physical asset is a different type of event. In the source story, it is a misunderstanding, while in Story A, it is a reckless action that causes damage. Therefore, the answer is:

The source story and Story A share similarities in the following ways:

1. Both involve a smaller entity (Bolon/Lincoln) being taken advantage of by a larger, more powerful entity (Mayonia/Chad).
2. The smaller entity tries to make a deal with the larger entity to avoid further harm (Bolon proposing a treaty with Mayonia, Moreland offering to help Chad rob Lincoln).
3. The larger entity ultimately overpowers the smaller entity and takes control (Mayonia overrunning Bolon and Salam, Chad robbing both Lincoln and Moreland).

Story B differs in that Moreland initially offers to help Chad rob Lincoln, which is not present in the source story. While this could be seen as an attempt to make the best of a bad situation, it does not align as closely with the source story as Story A does.</s>",,A,A

Explanation: In both stories, there is a character who is told to do something differently but ignores the advice and ends up getting into trouble. In Story A, the little girl Jenny continues to play in her neighbor's yard despite being told to play in her own yard. In Story B, the girl also disregards the advice given to her and goes to play in a different location, leading to her getting caught by her mother.

Therefore, both stories share a similar theme and structure, making Story B more analogous to the source story.

The reason is that both stories share similar elements of an individual being obsessed with their passion to the point of neglecting other important aspects of their life, and then experiencing an accident that makes them realize the importance of balancing their time and resources. However, the source story is about a king and his kingdom, while Story A is about an astronomer and his home. Story B also mentions the wife's complaint about the house, but it is not the main focus of the story like it is in Story A. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story as it shares the same themes and focuses on the individual's obsession and the consequences of that obsession.</s>",,A,A

The reason why Story A is more analogous to the source story is that in both stories, the main character is obsessed with one thing to the point of neglecting other important aspects of their life. In the source story, King Otto is obsessed with conquest and riches, while in Story A, Cornelius is obsessed with astronomy. Additionally, in both stories, there is a significant event that forces the main character to realize the importance of balancing their obsession with other responsibilities. In the source story, King Otto's carriage crashes through an unfinished bridge, and in Story A, Cornelius falls through a rotten floor in his house. Both events result in severe injuries to the main character and serve as a wake-up call for them to prioritize other areas of their life.

Story B is not as analogous to the source story because, in that story, Cornelius initially tries to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home but then gives up on the home renovations and goes back to being fully obsessed with astronomy. This is not the case in the source story, where King Otto initially listens to his counselor and abandons the bridge project but later realizes his mistake and orders the chamberlain to get him a new crown while he recovers from his injuries. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story as it follows the same pattern of obsession, neglect, and realization of the need to balance responsibilities.</s>",,A,B

The source story and Story A have similarities in the following aspects:

1. The protagonist is initially scared and tries to scare/drive away the threat (lion/beggar) with shouting, which only attracts more attention.
2. The protagonist then offers a valuable item to the threat to distract them and escape.
3. The protagonist realizes they have been deceived and something valuable is missing upon waking up.

Story B has some similarities but it is not as analogous as Story A because:

1. In Story B, the protagonist does not realize he has been deceived until after he has given away the second bag of coins.
2. In Story B, the protagonist does not mention feeling scared or trying to scare away the threat with shouting before offering the money.

Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the source story.</s>",,A,A

The key similarities between the source story and Story A are:

1. The protagonist is surprised by an unexpected intruder (lion in source story, beggar in Story A).
2. The protagonist initially tries to scare the intruder away with shouting (Frederick with the lion, Zebediah with the beggar).
3. The intruder is attracted to the shouting and comes closer (lion in source story, beggar in Story A).
4. The protagonist gives something valuable to the intruder to distract them and escape (lamb in source story, bag of coins in Story A).
5. The protagonist realizes later that another valuable item has been taken (lamb in source story, another bag of coins in Story A).

Story B also has some similarities, but it lacks the crucial element of the intruder being attracted to the protagonist's shouting. This makes Story A more analogous to the source story.</s>",,A,B

In the source story, the farmer (Mark) is also standing in one place (the henhouse) while the chickens are away (out in the yard), and they come back and attack him, causing him to leave in fear. The main similarity between the two stories is the unexpected behavior of the group towards the individual, causing the individual to leave in distress.

In both stories, Betty and Norma discover a twenty dollar bill and argue over it. In the source story, a third party, Sheriff Jones, intervenes and divides the land evenly between Smith and Johnson. In Story B, a third party, their teacher Mrs. Lee, intervenes and divides the money between Betty and Norma. The key difference is that in the source story, the two parties involved (Smith and Johnson) eventually become friends and realize they should have divided the land themselves. In Story A, the third party (Lee) takes the money and divides it, but Betty and Norma do not become friends or realize they should have divided it themselves.

The key similarity between the source story and Story A is that both Mrs. Jackson and McGhee became angry and sought revenge due to feeling unfairly treated by their respective superiors. In Story B, McGhee's actions preceded the captain's decision to take a vacation, making it less analogous to the source story.</s>",,A,A

The key similarity between the source story and Story A is that both Mrs. Jackson and McGhee became angry and took revenge due to feeling frustrated or denied something they wanted (salary increase and vacation, respectively). In Story B, McGhee's reaction occurs before the captain's announcement about the vacation, which is not present in the source story.</s>",,A,B

Let's think step by step.
","Both stories involve a person (or animal in the source story) getting into a dangerous situation with an authority figure, leading to their demise. However, the key difference is that in the source story, the animal (Pierre the cobra) initiates the violent action against the falcon, while in Story A, the human (Gene) is the one who attacks the policeman.

In Story B, it's the other way around - the policeman grabs Gene first. While the outcome of both stories is similar, the initial actions and roles of the characters are different.

Given this analysis, the answer is:
<ans> A </ans>

The reason is that the source story is about a cobra and a falcon, while Story A is about a human and a policeman. However, the structure and outcome of the stories share similarities, making Story A the more analogous comparison to the source story.</s>",,A,A

Let's think step by step.
","Both stories involve a young Gene, an unexpected encounter with a authority figure, and a tragic outcome. However, in the source story, it is a cobra and a falcon that are involved, while in Story A, it is Gene and a policeman. In Story B, the roles are reversed, with the policeman being the one who grabs Gene and drives away.

The key difference lies in the initial encounter and the actions of each character. In the source story, the cobra strikes the falcon out of fear, while in Story A, Gene hits the policeman out of panic. In Story B, Gene is the one who initiates the violence against the policeman.

Given that the source story involves a cobra and a falcon, and the comparison stories involve humans, it is important to consider the analogous situations. In the source story, the cobra strikes out of fear, and the falcon grabs the cobra in retaliation and to teach it a lesson. In Story A, Gene hits the policeman out of panic, and the policeman becomes incapacitated, leading to their tragic demise.

In Story B, the roles are reversed, with Gene being the aggressor, and the policeman being the one who is grabbed and driven away. This is not analogous to the source story, where the cobra is the one who initiates the violence.

Therefore, the answer is: <ans> A </ans></s>",,A,B
