In Story B, the character's failure to meet the requirement for graduation is not directly related to her daydreaming, but rather to her dislike of school.

2. In the source story, William's hatred for the room inspections and his daydreaming about food lead to his failure to pass the inspection and his disappointment.

In all three stories, the protagonists have a strong dislike for a particular situation or environment, and they are motivated by the promise of a reward to improve their situation. In the source story and both comparison stories, the protagonists spend a significant amount of time daydreaming about the reward, which ultimately prevents them from achieving it.

2. In the source story, William's hatred for the room inspections and his obsession with food lead him to neglect his room, resulting in his failure to pass the inspection.

The characters in all three stories are motivated by external rewards but ultimately fail to achieve them due to their own distractions.

3. The narrative structure of all three stories follows a similar pattern. The protagonist is introduced with their dislike for the current situation and their obsession with the reward. The reward is then promised, which motivates the protagonist. However, due to their distractions, they fail to achieve the reward.

Karla, an old hawk, lived at the top of a tall oak tree. One afternoon, she saw a hunter on the ground with a bow and some crude arrows that had no feathers. The hunter took aim and shot at the hawk but missed. Karla knew the hunter wanted her feathers so she glided down to the hunter and offered to give him a few. The hunter was so grateful that he pledged never to shoot at a hawk again. He went off and shot deer instead.

In the source story, Karla the hawk uses her valuable feathers to prevent a hunter from attacking her species. In Story A, Zerdia uses its valuable technology to prevent an attack from its neighbor, Gagrach. In Story B, Zerdia also uses its technology to prevent an attack but ultimately falls victim to it. The theme of using valuable resources to prevent conflict is present in all three stories.

2. In the source story, Karla is an old hawk who wants to protect her species. The hunter is a human who wants her feathers. Both characters have distinct motivations. In Story A, Zerdia is a country that wants to protect its technology. Gagrach is a country that wants to acquire it. In Story B, Zerdia is a country that wants to protect itself but ultimately fails. The development of the characters in the source story and Story A is similar as they both involve a trade or exchange to prevent conflict.

3. The narrative structure of the source story is that of a conflict between Karla and the hunter, followed by a resolution through negotiation. In Story A, the narrative structure is similar as there is a conflict between Zerdia and Gagrach, followed by a resolution through negotiation. In Story B, the narrative structure is different as there is a resolution through negotiation, followed by a conflict.

4. Both Story A and Story B involve the use of valuable resources to prevent conflict, and the characters in both stories engage in negotiations to achieve a peaceful resolution. However, in Story B, the ultimate outcome is not a peaceful resolution, but rather a failure on the part of Zerdia to protect itself.

In all three stories, the protagonists are surprised by an unexpected intruder or threat (lion in the source story, beggar in both comparison stories, and thief in Story B). The protagonists initially try to scare or distract the intruder, but this only makes the situation worse. In the end, they give something valuable to the intruder to buy time to escape.

2. In the source story, Frederick is a shepherd who is responsible for protecting his flock. He fails to do so initially but learns from his mistake and buys a weapon to defend himself in the future. In Story A, Zebediah is an old miser who is more concerned with his wealth than with helping others. He reacts fearfully to the beggar and ends up losing some of his money. In Story B, Zebediah also reacts fearfully to the beggar and ends up losing more money than in the first version of the story.

3. The narrative structure of the source story and Story A are similar in that both involve a sudden appearance of a threat, a failed attempt to scare the threat away, and the protagonist giving something valuable to the threat to escape. Story B differs in that it involves the protagonist discovering the missing money before the beggar appears.

4. While both comparison stories share some similarities with the source story, Story A is more closely related as it follows the same sequence of events more closely: the protagonist is surprised by an intruder, tries to scare them away, gives them something valuable to escape, and then realizes they have lost something valuable.

In all three stories, the protagonists are surprised by an unexpected threat (a lion in the source story, a thief in both comparison stories) and must act quickly to protect themselves. In each story, the protagonist makes a decision that temporarily resolves the immediate danger but ultimately leaves them vulnerable to further loss. In the source story, Frederick loses a lamb and later buys a weapon to defend his flock. In both comparison stories, Zebediah loses money and then secures the rest of his wealth.

2. The characters in all three stories are portrayed as being afraid and making hasty decisions. Frederick is scared of the lion and gives it a lamb to escape. Zebediah is frightened of the thief and throws money at him to buy time. In both stories, the protagonist's initial fear leads them to make a rash decision that ultimately leaves them in a worse position.

3. The narrative structure of all three stories follows a similar pattern. Each story begins with the protagonist in a relatively safe situation (Frederick tending his flock, Zebediah counting his money on his porch). The unexpected arrival of a threat (a lion, a thief) disrupts this safety and forces the protagonist to act quickly to protect themselves. The protagonist makes a decision that temporarily resolves the immediate danger but ultimately leaves them vulnerable to further loss. In each story, the protagonist then takes steps to mitigate this vulnerability (Frederick buying a weapon, Zebediah securing the rest of his money).

4. While both comparison stories share similarities with the source story in terms of theme and character development, Story A is more closely related in terms of narrative structure. In both the source story and Story A, the protagonist makes a decision that temporarily resolves the immediate danger but ultimately leaves them in a worse position. In Story B, while the protagonist's initial decision to yell at the beggar and throw money at him temporarily resolves the immediate danger, the fact that he falls asleep and loses another bag of coins later in the story does not follow the same pattern as the source story or Story A.

In all stories, the main character is left dealing with the aftermath and making decisions about their future.

2. In Story A, Linda's frustration with the girls' constant questioning and lack of appreciation leads to her reaction.

The source story and both comparison stories involve a character's desire for something (salary increase for Mrs. Jackson, vacation for McGhee) being denied, leading to anger and ultimately, violent revenge.

2. In the source story, Mrs. Jackson's character development is shown through her anger and her decision to take revenge. In both comparison stories, McGhee's character also undergoes a similar development, becoming upset and taking violent action in response to being denied what they want.

3. The narrative structure of all three stories is similar in that they each involve a character being denied something they desire, becoming angry, and then taking violent revenge. However, the source story and Story A differ in that the denial of what the character wants comes before the act of revenge, while in Story B, the act of revenge comes before the denial.

4. Based on the comparisons, Story A is less closely related to the Source Story as the denial of what the character wants comes after the act of revenge. In the Source Story, Mrs. Jackson hears about the principal's salary increase before she takes revenge, while in Story A, McGhee tries to blow up the captain's cabin before being told that everyone else must remain on the ship.

In all three stories, there is a conflict between two characters, one of whom is larger or more powerful than the other. In the Source Story, it is a cobra and a falcon, in Story A it is a boy and a policeman, and in Story B it is also a boy and a policeman. In each story, the smaller character reacts in fear or panic, leading to a tragic outcome.

2. In the Source Story, the cobra and the falcon are wild animals with no development or motivation beyond their instinctual reactions. In Story A and Story B, the characters of Gene and the policeman have more complexity. They are identified as a boy and a policeman, implying that they have backgrounds and personalities. However, their actions and consequences are similar to those in the Source Story.

3. The narrative structure of all three stories follows a similar pattern. There is an initial encounter between the two characters, a conflict arises, and the outcome is tragic for both parties. The stories differ in the specific details of the encounter and the circumstances of the tragic ending.

4. Both Story A and Story B have elements that align with the Source Story, such as the conflict between two characters and the tragic outcome. However, Story A has some differences, such as the policeman being the one to initiate the conflict by approaching Gene. In the Source Story, it is the cobra that strikes first. Story B is more closely related to the Source Story as it follows the same sequence of events more closely, with the boy striking first and the policeman becoming incapacitated, leading to their tragic demise.
