Story A is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). Both stories involve a manager (Mr. Newton in Ref and Ms. Boyce in A) who experiences an accident due to a new product (sharp razor in Ref and intense heat lamp in A) that their company has developed. In both cases, the accident leads to the recommendation of a safety feature (safety razor in Ref and warning label in A) which the manager initially considers unnecessary but later deems absolutely necessary after the incident.

Story B is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). In both stories, a new product with enhanced capabilities is introduced (sharp metal in Ref, intense heat filament in Story B). In both cases, an incident involving the person in charge of the product (Mr. Newton in Ref, Ms. Boyce in Story B) leads to a recommendation for a safety feature (safety razor in Ref, warning label in Story B). Finally, both individuals consider the safety feature necessary after the incident and implement it immediately.

In both stories, a powerful entity (the hunter in Ref and Gagrach in A) attempts to take something valuable from a weaker entity (Karla the hawk in Ref and Zerdia in A). However, the attempt fails, and instead of continuing the conflict, the powerful entity agrees to a peaceful resolution after receiving what they wanted.

Story B is the analogous story to the reference story. In both stories, the main character (Peter in the reference story and Quiggly Company in Story B) is influenced by the perception that everyone else is doing something (getting a tan or investing in space manufacturing) and decides to follow suit, despite warnings about the potential dangers or risks involved. In both cases, the characters face negative consequences (Peter's severe sunburn and Quiggly Company's financial loss) as a result of their decisions. Story A, on the other hand, does not follow this pattern as closely, as the company's decision to invest in space manufacturing is not driven by the same kind of social pressure as in the reference and Story B.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

Story B is the analogous story to the reference story. In both stories, the main character (Peter in the reference story and Quiggly Company in Story B) takes a risky action (tanning in the sun and investing in space manufacturing, respectively) based on the belief that they need to conform to what everyone else is doing. In both cases, the risky action leads to negative consequences (severe sunburn and financial ruin), and the characters decide to abandon the risky endeavor and return to their original pursuits (Iceland and manufacturing conventional electrical components). Story A, on the other hand, does not follow this pattern as closely, as Quiggly Company decides to return to their original business after receiving warnings from market analysts, without experiencing any negative consequences.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

Story B is analogous to the reference story (Ref) because both stories involve a character (Julius in Ref and Cindy in B) who desires something (pears in Ref and records in B) that is out of their reach due to cost. In both stories, the characters experience disappointment as a result of their inability to obtain the desired item. Additionally, both stories involve the characters contemplating the value of the desired item (Julius thinking the pears are rotten, and Cindy thinking the records look bad) before coming to the conclusion that they cannot afford them.

Ref: Boris and Ivan thought well of one anothers' skill in business and resolved to open up a store together. As ill luck would have it, Ivan was quite absent-minded and he threw out a large amount of cash. This annoyed Boris who therefore demanded that Ivan have nothing to do with the monetary matters of their new store. Later, however, Ivan redeemed himself by selling his fancy new stereo set to replace the lost cash.

Story B is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). In both stories, the characters John and Christine are in a relationship and decide to get married. In both stories, Christine's recklessness causes an issue with John's vehicle, leading to John insisting that Christine not drive his car again.

Story B is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). In both stories, there is a power dynamic between the two smaller entities (Bolon and Salam in Ref, Lincoln and Moreland in Story B) and a larger, dominant entity (Mayonia in Ref, Chad in Story B). In both stories, the smaller entities try to make the best of the situation by making deals with the dominant entity, but ultimately fail and are overpowered. Additionally, the smaller entities are unable to prevent the dominance of the larger entity due to their preoccupation with their own internal issues (Bolon focusing on controlling Salam, Moreland focusing on overpowering Lincoln).<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

Story A is the analogous story to the reference story. In both stories, the main character is obsessed with a single pursuit (King Otto with conquest and riches, Cornelius with astronomy) and neglects other important aspects of their life (bridges and domestic expenditures for King Otto, house maintenance for Cornelius). In both stories, a mishap (carriage crash for King Otto, house floor collapse for Cornelius) leads to a realization that they need to balance their priorities. After the incident, both characters decide to make changes to balance their time and attention between their obsession and the neglected areas of their lives.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,B

Ref: Once there was a teacher named Mrs. Jackson who wanted a salary increase. One day, the principal said that he was increasing his own salary by 20 percent. However, he said, there was not enough money to give the teachers a salary increase.
When Mrs. Jackson heard this she became so angry that she decided to take revenge. The next day, Mrs. Jackson used gasoline to set fire to the principal's office. Then she went to a bar and got drunk.

Story B is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). In both stories, a character (Mrs. Jackson in Ref and McGhee in Story B) becomes frustrated with a perceived unfairness (salary increase for the principal in Ref and vacation time for the captain in Story B) and decides to take revenge by causing destruction (setting fire to the principal's office in Ref and blowing up the captain's cabin in Story B). The key elements of frustration, perceived unfairness, and revenge are present in both stories, making Story B the analogous story to the reference story.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

Story B is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). In both stories, a conflict arises between two characters (a cobra and a falcon in Ref, and a boy and a policeman in Story B). In both stories, the conflict escalates and leads to the death of both characters in a dramatic and ironic manner (the falcon and cobra falling to their death at a wedding, and the boy and policeman dying in a car accident). Additionally, the structure of the stories is similar, with a build-up of tension followed by a tragic climax. Story A, on the other hand, has a different structure and lacks the ironic twist found in the other two stories.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

Story B is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). In both stories, a conflict arises between a character (Pierre the cobra in Ref and Gene in Story B) and another entity (a falcon in Ref and a policeman in Story B). In both stories, the conflict escalates, leading to the death of both characters. Additionally, the setting of an outdoor wedding ceremony in Ref is replaced by a more common setting in Story B, but the overall structure and theme of conflict and consequences are maintained.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B
