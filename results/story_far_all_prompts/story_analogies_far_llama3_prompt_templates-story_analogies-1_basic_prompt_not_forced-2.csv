Peter was a young man from Iceland who moved to Florida one summer. He was very self-conscious about his fair skin. Peter thought that people would not accept him unless he tanned himself golden-brown like every one else.
So Peter spent a whole day in the sun, trying to get a tan. He didn't understand how dangerous the sun could be. Consequently, by evening he had second degree burns over most of his body and he had to go to the hospital. Peter decided that Florida was not for him and booked the next ocean liner back to Iceland. He spent the whole trip under a large umbrella keeping cool.

The source story and Story A share similar elements:

* Both involve a character (Julius/mule and Cindy) who is curious about something (pears/records) and wants to investigate further.
* Both characters have a prediction or hunch about the quality of the item (rotten pears/bad records).
* Both characters are disappointed when they are unable to fulfill their desire (Julius can't jump for the pears, Cindy can't afford the records).
* Both characters have a thought process that is similar, with a mix of curiosity, prediction, and disappointment.

Story B, on the other hand, does not share these similarities. The character in Story B does not have a prediction or hunch about the records, and instead simply becomes disappointed and then gets over it.",,A,A
