Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's identify the key elements in the reference story (Ref):

1. The protagonist, William, is in a psychiatric hospital and struggles with keeping his room clean.
2. He daydreams about food, specifically gingerbread.
3. The nurse promises him gingerbread as an incentive to clean his room.
4. Despite his efforts, he doesn't pass the inspection and doesn't get the gingerbread.

Now, let's analyze Story A:

1. The protagonist, Karen, despises high school and loves vacations.
2. She daydreams about going to Hawaii.
3. Her father promises her a trip to Hawaii as an incentive to improve her grades.
4. Despite her efforts, she fails to graduate and doesn't go to Hawaii.

And Story B:

1. The protagonist, Karen, dislikes high school and struggles with her grades.
2. She loves vacations, specifically going to Hawaii.
3. Her father promises her a trip to Hawaii as an incentive to pass enough classes to graduate.
4. Despite her efforts, she fails to graduate and doesn't go to Hawaii.

Comparing the key elements in all three stories, we can see that Story A is the most analogous to the reference story (Ref). Both stories involve a protagonist who struggles with their current situation (William with his room and Karen with her grades), daydreams about something they desire (gingerbread for William, a trip to Hawaii for Karen), and receive an incentive from an authority figure (nurse for William, father for Karen) to improve their situation. However, in both cases, they fail to achieve their goal due to insufficient effort or time.

Therefore, the final answer is: <ans> A </ans>.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,A

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the similarities and differences between the reference story (Ref) and the two other stories (A and B).

Ref Story:
- William is a patient in a psychiatric hospital.
- He is confined indoors and dislikes monthly room inspections.
- He daydreams about food.
- The nurse promises him gingerbread if he cleans his room.
- He fails to clean his room in time and doesn't get the gingerbread.

Story A:
- Karen dislikes high school.
- She struggles academically and loves vacations.
- Her father promises her a trip to Hawaii if she graduates.
- She fails to graduate and doesn't go to Hawaii.

Story B:
- Karen struggles in high school and loves vacations.
- She daydreams about going to Hawaii.
- Her father promises her a trip to Hawaii if she graduates.
- She fails to graduate and doesn't go to Hawaii.

Now, let's compare the stories:

1. Both Story A and Story B involve a character who struggles academically and has a strong desire for a vacation (Hawaii in both cases).
2. Both stories have a motivational element where a trip is promised if certain conditions are met (graduating in Story A, improving grades in Story B).
3. In both stories, the characters fail to meet the conditions and do not get the promised trip.

Based on these similarities, it is clear that Story B is the most analogous to the reference story (Ref). Both stories involve a character who struggles academically, has a strong desire for a vacation, and fails to meet the conditions for receiving the vacation.

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's identify the key elements in the reference story (Ref):

1. Mr. Newton is the manager of a company that makes razors.
2. An inventor in his company perfects a new metal that makes razors sharper.
3. Mr. Newton cuts himself severely with a new razor.
4. The inventor recommends a safety feature to prevent injuries.
5. Mr. Newton considers the safety feature necessary and starts producing safety razors.

Now, let's analyze Story A:

1. Ms. Boyce is in charge of installing heat lamps.
2. A supplier perfects a new filament that produces more intense heat.
3. Ms. Boyce is seriously burned while using a new heat lamp.
4. The supplier recommends a warning label to protect people from hurting themselves.
5. Ms. Boyce considers the labels necessary and has them printed immediately.

Story A closely follows the structure and key elements of the reference story. The roles are reversed (manager to installer, razor to heat lamp, metal to filament), but the overall narrative is similar: an innovation leads to an accident, which in turn leads to the recommendation of a safety feature, and the protagonist considers it necessary and implements it.

Now, let's analyze Story B:

1. Ms. Boyce is in charge of installing sun lamps.
2. A supplier perfects a new filament that produces more intense heat.
3. The supplier recommends a warning label to protect people from hurting themselves.
4. Ms. Boyce initially considers the labels unnecessary.
5. Ms. Boyce is seriously burned while using a new heat lamp, and she has the warning labels printed immediately.

While Story B shares some elements with the reference story, it deviates in a significant way: Ms. Boyce initially considers the warning labels unnecessary, which contradicts the reference story where Mr. Newton considers the safety feature necessary from the start.

Based on this analysis, the answer is:

<ans> A </ans>

Story A is the most analogous to the reference story, as it closely follows the structure and key elements of the reference story, with the roles reversed and a consistent narrative arc.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,A

","First, let's analyze the reference story (Ref) and the two other stories (A and B) to identify their key elements and themes.

Ref Story:
1. Joseph is a millionaire who hires a chauffeur to drive his Rolls-Royce.
2. He brags about never being late for conferences due to the chauffeur.
3. One morning, the chauffeur is asleep, and Joseph is late for his conference.
4. Joseph hires a second chauffeur to prevent future delays, which turns out to be expensive.

Story A:
1. Alexander has two wives in two separate houses.
2. He boasts about always having enough food with both wives.
3. One day, he goes to his first wife, who has only prepared for herself and their baby.
4. He then goes to his second wife, who thinks he's eating at the other house.
5. Alexander ends up without dinner.

Story B:
1. Alexander lives with his wife and boasts about always having enough food.
2. One day, he's hungry, but his wife thinks he's eating elsewhere and prepares only for herself and their baby.
3. Alexander goes without dinner.
4. To prevent future hunger, he marries a second wife.

Now, let's compare these stories to the reference story:

- Story A involves a man with two wives, similar to the reference story's Joseph and his chauffeur. However, the theme of boasting and the consequences of miscommunication are not as strong in Story A.
- Story B has a similar theme of boasting about having enough food, and the consequences of miscommunication, which aligns more closely with the reference story.

Based on this analysis, the analogous story to the reference story is:

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the reference story (Ref) and the two other stories (A/B) to identify their key elements:

Ref Story:
1. Karla, an old hawk, lives at the top of a tall oak tree.
2. A hunter tries to shoot Karla but misses.
3. Karla offers her feathers to the hunter, who then promises not to shoot at hawks again.

Story A:
1. Zerdia, a small country, creates the world's smartest computer.
2. Zerdia is attacked by its neighbor, Gagrach, but the attack fails.
3. Zerdia offers to sell its computers to Gagrach, who then promises not to attack Zerdia again.

Story B:
1. Zerdia, a small country, creates the world's smartest computer.
2. Zerdia sells a supercomputer to Gagrach to prevent an attack.
3. Zerdia is later attacked by surprise, and it's discovered that Gagrach used Zerdian supercomputers to guide its missiles.

Now, let's compare these stories to the reference story:

Story A is analogous to the reference story because both involve a situation where one party (Karla the hawk and Zerdia the country) offers something valuable to another party (the hunter and Gagrach) to prevent harm or conflict. In both cases, the offering party is successful in preventing further conflict or harm.

Story B, on the other hand, does not follow the same pattern. While Zerdia tries to prevent conflict by selling a supercomputer, the outcome is not as expected, and Zerdia ends up being attacked anyway.

Therefore, the final answer is: <ans> A </ans> Story A is analogous to the reference story.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,A

","First, let's analyze the reference story (Ref) and the two other stories (A/B) to identify their key elements:

Ref Story:
1. Karla, an old hawk, lives at the top of a tall oak tree.
2. A hunter with crude arrows tries to shoot Karla but misses.
3. Karla offers the hunter her feathers in exchange for a promise not to shoot at hawks again.
4. The hunter keeps his promise and starts hunting deer instead.

Story A:
1. Zerdia, a small country, creates the world's smartest computer.
2. Zerdia sells a supercomputer to its neighbor, Gagrach, to prevent an attack.
3. Gagrach attacks Zerdia using Zerdian supercomputers, which were supposed to prevent the attack.
4. Zerdia is overwhelmed by the attack and realizes the missiles were guided by their own technology.

Story B:
1. Zerdia, a small country, creates the world's smartest computer.
2. Zerdia is attacked by its neighbor, Gagrach, but the missiles are poorly aimed and fail.
3. Zerdia realizes Gagrach wants Zerdian computers and offers to sell some to prevent future attacks.
4. Gagrach is pleased and promises not to attack Zerdia again.

Now, let's compare these stories to the reference story:

- Story A has a similar structure to the reference story, with a conflict between two parties (Zerdia and Gagrach) and a resolution involving a trade or exchange (supercomputer for a promise not to attack). However, the resolution in Story A is not as successful as in the reference story, as Gagrach still attacks Zerdia despite the exchange.

- Story B also has a similar structure to the reference story, with a conflict between two parties (Zerdia and Gagrach) and a resolution involving a trade or exchange (computers for a promise not to attack). The resolution in Story B is successful, as Gagrach keeps its promise not to attack Zerdia again.

Based on this analysis, the story that is most analogous to the reference story is:

<ans> B </ans>

Story B shares the key elements of conflict, resolution through exchange, and a successful outcome, making it the most analogous to the reference story.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

Ref Story:
1. Peter, a young man from Iceland, moves to Florida.
2. He is self-conscious about his fair skin and wants to tan.
3. He spends a day in the sun, not understanding the dangers of sun exposure.
4. He ends up with second-degree burns and has to go to the hospital.
5. He decides Florida is not for him and returns to Iceland.

Story A:
1. Quiggly Company is a small company that manufactures electrical components.
2. They enter the integrated circuit market.
3. They believe they need sophisticated space factories to be competitive.
4. They invest heavily in space manufacturing, not realizing the financial risk.
5. They suffer significant financial losses and decide to exit the integrated circuit market.

Story B:
1. Quiggly Company is a small company that manufactures conventional electrical components.
2. They start producing integrated circuits.
3. They believe space manufacturing is the key to success in the integrated circuit market.
4. Market analysts warn them about the high costs and competitive nature of space manufacturing.
5. Quiggly Company decides to stick with conventional electrical components due to the warnings.

Now, let's compare the stories to the reference story:

- Story A has a similar theme of a company taking a significant risk without fully understanding the consequences, leading to financial loss. This is analogous to the reference story, where Peter takes a risk by spending a day in the sun without understanding the dangers and ends up with severe burns.

- Story B, on the other hand, has a theme of a company heeding warnings and avoiding a risky decision. This is not analogous to the reference story, where Peter does not heed warnings and ends up in a negative situation.

Based on this analysis, the answer is:

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the key elements of the reference story (Ref):

1. The protagonist, Julius, discovers something desirable (pears) that he cannot reach.
2. He is disappointed because he cannot obtain what he wants.
3. He deals with his disappointment by going to sleep and dreaming about his desire.

Now, let's analyze the key elements of Story A:

1. The protagonist, Cindy, discovers something desirable (records) that she cannot afford.
2. She is disappointed because she cannot obtain what she wants.
3. She deals with her disappointment by changing her opinion about the records.

And the key elements of Story B:

1. The protagonist, Cindy, discovers something desirable (records) that she cannot afford.
2. She is disappointed because she cannot obtain what she wants.
3. She deals with her disappointment by acknowledging her inability to afford the records.

Comparing these elements, we can see that Story A and Story B both have a protagonist who discovers something desirable that they cannot obtain, leading to disappointment. However, the way they deal with their disappointment is different: in Story A, Cindy changes her opinion about the records, while in Story B, Cindy simply acknowledges her inability to afford the records.

Based on this analysis, the story that is most analogous to the reference story is:

3. Percy was sad and vowed to give up singing.

Story A:
1. Sam traveled the world buying things and ran out of money.
2. He visited his mother, hoping for a loan in return for a gift from Tibet.
3. His mother was disappointed and called the gift ""junk.""

Story B:
1. Sam traveled the world buying things and ran out of money.
2. He visited his mother, hoping for a loan in return for a gift from Tibet.
3. His mother was disappointed and refused to give him money, saying she earned it through hard work.

Now, let's compare the stories to the reference story:

- Story A has some similarities with the reference story, such as the character visiting someone with the expectation of receiving something in return for a gift. However, the disappointment expressed by the character in Story A is due to the quality of the gift, not the performance of the character.

- Story B is more analogous to the reference story. Both involve a character visiting someone (a squirrel in the reference story and Sam's mother in Story B) with the expectation of receiving something in return for a gift or performance. In both stories, the character is disappointed and refuses to provide the requested item.

Based on this analysis, the answer is:

<ans> B </ans>

Story B is more analogous to the reference story due to the shared elements of expectation, disappointment, and refusal to provide the requested item.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the reference story (Ref) and the two other stories (A/B) to identify their key elements:

Ref Story:
1. Percy the mockingbird sang for the squirrel expecting sunflower seeds in return.
2. The squirrel was disappointed in Percy's singing and refused to give him seeds.
3. Percy was sad and vowed to give up singing.

Story A:

2. He visited his mother, hoping she would give him a loan in return for a gift from Tibet.
3. His mother was disappointed and refused to give him money, calling the gift ""a piece of junk.""

Now, let's compare the stories:

- Both Story A and Story B have similarities with the reference story in terms of the character's actions and the outcome. In all three stories, a character performs an action (singing for seeds in Ref, buying gifts in A/B) expecting something in return (seeds in Ref, money in A/B), but the recipient is disappointed and refuses to provide the expected reward.

- Story B is more similar to the reference story than Story A because both involve a character performing an action (singing in Ref, buying gifts in B) expecting something in return (seeds in Ref, money in B), and both have the recipient expressing disappointment and refusing to provide the expected reward.

Based on this analysis, the answer is:

1. A dog named Leonard has a steak.
2. Leonard accidentally drops the steak into the lake.
3. Leonard sees another dog with a steak.
4. Leonard tries to take the other dog's steak, but loses a tooth in the process.

Now, let's analyze the key elements of Story A:

1. Charlie has an expensive pocket watch.
2. Charlie accidentally drops the watch and it shatters.
3. Charlie sees another man with an expensive watch.
4. Charlie tries to take the other man's watch, but it's a policeman, and he gets caught.

And the key elements of Story B:

1. Charlie has an expensive pocket watch.
2. Charlie sees another man with an expensive watch.
3. Charlie mistakenly believes the other man's watch is his reflection and tries to take it.
4. In the process, Charlie drops his own watch and both watches shatter.

Comparing the elements of the reference story with those of Stories A and B, we can see that Story A is more analogous to the reference story. Both involve a character losing their valuable item (a steak in the reference story, a pocket watch in Story A), accidentally dropping it, and then seeing another person with a similar item and attempting to take it, with negative consequences.

In Story B, while there is a similarity in the character losing their valuable item and seeing another person with a similar item, the story does not follow the same sequence of events as the reference story. Charlie's mistake in Story B is not directly related to losing his own item, and the negative consequences are different (both watches shatter instead of one being taken).

1. A dog named Leonard has a steak.
2. Leonard drops the steak into the lake and loses it.
3. Leonard sees another dog with a steak.
4. Leonard tries to take the other dog's steak, but loses a tooth in the process.

Story A:
1. Charlie has an expensive pocket watch.
2. Charlie sees his reflection and mistakenly thinks it's another man with an expensive watch.
3. Charlie drops his own watch, and it shatters.
4. Charlie tries to take the other man's watch, but it's just his reflection.

1. Charlie has an expensive pocket watch.
2. Charlie accidentally drops his watch, and it shatters.
3. Charlie sees another man with an expensive watch.
4. Charlie tries to take the other man's watch, but the man is a policeman.

Now, let's compare the stories to the reference story:

- Story A has a similar theme of greed and misfortune, as Charlie mistakenly believes he sees another man with an expensive watch and loses his own in the process.
- Story B also has a theme of misfortune, as Charlie accidentally drops his watch and then tries to take another man's watch, only to find out it's a policeman.

However, Story A is more analogous to the reference story because it involves a character (Charlie) who mistakenly believes he sees another person with a valuable item (the other man with an expensive watch) and ends up losing his own valuable item (his pocket watch) due to his mistake. This mirrors the situation in the reference story, where Leonard mistakenly believes he sees another dog with a steak and ends up losing his own steak in the process.

1. Two characters, Boris and Ivan, are partners in a business venture.
2. Ivan makes a mistake by losing money, which angers Boris.
3. Ivan redeems himself by replacing the lost money with a sale.

Now, let's analyze the key elements of Story A:

1. Two characters, John and Christine, are in a romantic relationship and plan to marry.
2. Christine makes a mistake by denting John's car, which upsets him.
3. John insists that Christine never drives his car again.

And the key elements of Story B:

1. Two characters, John and Christine, are in a romantic relationship and plan to marry.
2. John discovers that Christine is a reckless driver, which concerns him.
3. John insists that Christine never drives his car, which upsets her, and she intentionally dents his car.

Comparing the elements of the reference story with Stories A and B, we can see the following similarities and differences:

- Both the reference story and Story A involve two characters in a partnership (business in Ref, romantic relationship in A).
- Both the reference story and Story B involve one character making a mistake that upsets the other (losing money in Ref, denting the car in B).
- Story A lacks the element of redemption found in the reference story, while Story B has a similar element with Christine's intentional act of denting the car.

Based on these comparisons, Story B is more analogous to the reference story as it shares more key elements and similarities in the character dynamics and the consequences of their actions.

2. Moreland decides to make the best of the situation by overpowering Lincoln. Lincoln runs to find a policeman, Moreland catches him, and Chad arrives.
3. Moreland offers to let Chad rob Lincoln in exchange for being left alone, but Chad robs both of them. Moreland is too busy holding Lincoln down to prevent it.

Comparing the key elements of the reference story and the two other stories, we can see that Story A is more analogous to the reference story. In both the reference story and Story A, there is a smaller entity (Bolon/Salam or Lincoln) that is being taken advantage of by a larger, more powerful entity (Mayonia/Chad). Additionally, the smaller entity makes a deal with the larger entity, but ultimately ends up being overpowered and controlled by the larger entity.

Therefore, the final answer is: <ans> A </ans>.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,B

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's identify the key elements in the reference story (Ref):

1. A farmer named Beedle has a choice apricot tree that he values highly.
2. Every year, he gives fruit from this tree as presents to people he knows.
3. One year, the tree begins to wither and stops producing fruit.
4. The judge, who enjoyed the apricots, decides to take the tree to his own garden and pays Beedle for it.
5. After being transplanted, the tree produces delicious apricots again and wins first prize in the county fair.

Now, let's analyze the two other stories (A and B) in relation to the reference story:

Story A:
1. Mr. Gerson has a canary that he values highly.
2. He invites friends over to hear the canary sing.
3. One autumn, the canary becomes ill and stops singing.
4. A veterinarian friend buys the canary, takes care of it, and it starts singing again.

Story B:
1. Mr. Gerson has a canary that he values highly.
2. He invites friends over to hear the canary sing.
3. A wealthy businessman wants the canary, so he buys it and moves it to his city house.
4. After being moved, the canary becomes fatally ill and stops singing.

Comparing the stories, we can see that Story A has a structure and outcome similar to the reference story (Ref). Both stories involve a valued pet (apricot tree in Ref, canary in A), the pet's decline and subsequent recovery after being moved to a new owner's care.

In contrast, Story B has a different outcome (the canary becomes fatally ill after being moved), which doesn't align with the positive resolution in the reference story.

Therefore, the final answer is: <ans> A </ans> as Story A is more analogous to the reference story.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,A

3. Jenny disobeys and hides at the playground, then goes home to play with her dog.
4. She gets caught by her mother and wishes she hadn't listened to her neighbor.

Now, let's compare these stories to the reference story:

- Story A has some similarities with the reference story, such as a character disobeying a request and getting caught as a result. However, the consequences and the overall theme are different.
- Story B has more similarities with the reference story. Both involve a character following a piece of advice that leads to their capture and regret. The characters in both stories are also named Morris and Jenny, which could be a hint at their analogous nature.

4. Otto abandons the bridge project for a military invasion.
5. Otto crashes through an unfinished bridge, gets injured, and realizes the need for balance.

Story A:

2. He spends too much time renovating his home into an observatory.
3. His wife Agatha complains about the lack of attention to his job (astronomy).
4. Cornelius goes back to focusing solely on astronomy.
5. Cornelius falls through an unfinished floor, gets injured, and learns to balance his time.

Story B:
1. Cornelius is obsessed with astronomy.
2. He neglects maintaining his house due to his focus on astronomy.
3. His wife Agatha complains about the lack of attention to the house.
4. Cornelius doesn't change his behavior initially.
5. Cornelius falls through a rotten floor, gets injured, and learns to balance his time.

Comparing the stories, we can see that Story A is more analogous to the reference story (Ref) than Story B. In both stories, the main character is obsessed with one aspect of their life (conquest/bridges in Ref, astronomy in A) and neglects another important aspect (domestic expenditures/home maintenance in Ref, job/home renovation in A).

1. Cornelius is obsessed with astronomy.
2. He turns his home into an observatory.
3. Agatha complains about his lack of attention to his job (astronomy).
4. The house becomes unlivable due to Cornelius's neglect.
5. Cornelius falls through a collapsed floor, gets injured, and realizes the need for balance.

Comparing the stories, we can see that Story A is more analogous to the reference story (Ref) than Story B. In both stories, the main character is obsessed with a particular interest (conquest and riches for King Otto, astronomy for Cornelius), and their spouse complains about the neglect of their home. The main character then experiences a mishap (bridge crash for King Otto, falling through a rotten floor for Cornelius) that leads them to realize the need for balance in their lives.

Therefore, the final answer is: <ans> A </ans> Story A is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref).<|end_of_turn|>",,A,B

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the similarities and differences between the reference story (Ref) and the two other stories (A/B).

Ref Story:
1. Frederick, a shepherd, is tending his flock near a forest.
2. A lion appears and Frederick tries to scare it away, but it comes closer.
3. Frederick gives the lion a lamb to escape and leads the rest of the flock away.
4. Later, he realizes another lamb is missing.
5. Frederick buys a blunderbuss to defend his flock in the future.

Story A:
1. Zebediah, an old miser, is counting his money on his porch.
2. A beggar appears and Zebediah tries to scare him away, but he comes closer.
3. Zebediah throws a bag of coins to the beggar to escape, then hides the rest of his money.
4. When Zebediah wakes up, he discovers another bag of coins is missing.

Story B:
1. Zebediah, an old miser, is counting his money on his porch and dozes off.
2. He wakes up to find a bag of coins missing and starts yelling for the thief.
3. A beggar appears and Zebediah tries to scare him away, but he comes closer.
4. Zebediah throws a second bag of coins to the beggar to escape, then hides the rest of his money.

Now, let's compare the stories to the reference story:

- Story A has some similarities with the reference story, such as the protagonist being frightened by an unexpected visitor (lion vs. beggar), trying to scare them away, and losing something valuable (lamb vs. bag of coins).
- Story B has more similarities with the reference story, including the protagonist being frightened by an unexpected visitor (lion vs. beggar), trying to scare them away, and losing something valuable (lamb vs. bag of coins). Additionally, the actions taken by the protagonist in both stories (giving the predator something else to occupy them and escaping with the rest of the flock/money) are very similar.

Based on these comparisons, it is clear that Story B is more analogous to the reference story than Story A. Therefore, the final answer is:

<ans> B </ans><|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the similarities and differences between the reference story (Ref) and the two other stories (A/B).

Ref Story:
1. Frederick, a shepherd, is tending his flock near a forest.
2. A lion appears and Frederick tries to scare it away, but it comes closer.
3. Frederick gives the lion a lamb to distract it and leads the rest of the flock away.
4. Frederick takes a nap and discovers a second lamb is missing.
5. Frederick buys a blunderbuss to protect his flock in the future.

Story A:
1. Zebediah, an old miser, is counting money on his porch.
2. He dozes off and wakes up to find a bag of coins missing.
3. He yells at a beggar who appears, attracting the beggar's attention.
4. Zebediah throws a second bag of coins to the beggar to distract him.
5. He takes the remaining money into the house and locks the door.
6. Zebediah wakes up again to find another bag of coins missing.

Story B:
1. Zebediah, an old miser, is counting money on his porch.
2. A beggar appears and Zebediah yells at him, attracting the beggar's attention.
3. Zebediah throws a bag of coins to the beggar to distract him.
4. He takes the remaining money into the house and locks the door.
5. Zebediah wakes up to find another bag of coins missing.

Comparing the stories, we can see that both Story A and Story B share some similarities with the reference story (Ref):

1. Both involve a character who is frightened by an unexpected visitor (lion in Ref, beggar in A/B).
2. Both characters attempt to distract the visitor with an offering (lamb in Ref, coins in A/B).
3. Both characters take some form of action to protect themselves or their possessions (leading the flock away in Ref, locking the door in A/B).
4. Both stories end with the protagonist discovering that something valuable is missing (lamb in Ref, coins in A/B).

However, Story A also includes an additional element of the protagonist's initial fear leading to the loss of his money, which is not present in the reference story (Ref).

Based on these similarities and differences, I would conclude that:

<ans> B </ans> is the most analogous story to the reference story (Ref). Both stories involve a character who is frightened by an unexpected visitor, attempts to distract the visitor with an offering, takes some form of action to protect themselves, and ends with the protagonist discovering that something valuable is missing.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the key elements of the reference story (Ref):

1. The protagonist is a chicken farmer named Mark.
2. Mark is collecting eggs when his chickens return and attack him.
3. The chickens chase Mark out of the henhouse, and a thief steals the eggs.
4. Mark gets injured and quits chicken farming, going on a vacation in Africa.

Now, let's analyze the key elements of Story A:

1. The protagonist is Linda, the director of a girl scout camp.
2. Linda is thinking about the camp while the girls are hiking.
3. The girls return and pester Linda with questions.
4. Linda gets upset and runs off, and a tidal wave hits the camp, washing away sleeping bags.

And the key elements of Story B:

1. A tidal wave hits a girl scout camp, washing away sleeping bags.
2. Linda, the camp director, returns and finds the tragedy.
3. Linda is thinking about what to do when the girl scouts return and pester her.
4. Linda gets upset and runs off, and the girls are left without sleeping bags.

Comparing the key elements of all three stories, we can see that Story B is the most analogous to the reference story (Ref). Both stories involve a protagonist who is responsible for a group of animals (chickens in Ref, girl scouts in Story B), and both protagonists face unexpected challenges (chickens attacking in Ref, tidal wave in Story B) that lead to negative consequences (stolen eggs in Ref, destroyed camp in Story B).

2. They fight over who saw it first.
3. Sheriff Jones intervenes and divides the land evenly between them.
4. Smith and Johnson become friends and help each other build houses.

Story A:
1. Two individuals, Betty and Norma, discover a twenty-dollar bill.
2. They argue over who saw it first.
3. Their teacher, Mrs. Lee, intervenes and divides the money between them.
4. Betty and Norma realize they should have divided the money themselves.

Story B:
1. Two individuals, Betty and Norma, discover a twenty-dollar bill.
2. They argue over who saw it first.
3. Lee takes the money without dividing it.
4. By the time Betty and Norma realize they should have divided the money, it's too late.

Now, let's compare these stories to the reference story:

- Both Story A and Story B involve two individuals discovering something valuable (land in Ref, money in A/B) and arguing over who saw it first.
- In Story A, an external authority (Mrs. Lee) intervenes and divides the valuable item, leading to a resolution and a realization that they should have done it themselves.
- In Story B, the external authority (Lee) takes the valuable item without dividing it, and by the time the individuals realize their mistake, it's too late.

Based on these comparisons, Story A is more analogous to the reference story (Ref) because it follows a similar pattern of conflict, intervention, resolution, and learning. In both stories, the characters fight over a valuable item, an external authority intervenes and divides it, and the characters learn a lesson about cooperation.

1. Two individuals (Smith and Johnson) discover something valuable (a valley) in a shared space (Oregon Territory).
2. They both want the valuable thing and start fighting over it.
3. An external authority (Sheriff Jones) intervenes and divides the valuable thing evenly between them.
4. The two individuals realize their mistake and become friends, working together to build each other's houses.

Now, let's analyze Story A and Story B in relation to these key elements:

Story A:
1. Two individuals (Betty and Norma) discover something valuable (a twenty-dollar bill) in a shared space (the floor).
2. They both want the valuable thing and start arguing over it.
3. An external authority (Lee) intervenes but takes the money for herself instead of dividing it.
4. By the time Betty and Norma realize their mistake, it's too late.

Story B:
1. Two individuals (Betty and Norma) discover something valuable (a twenty-dollar bill) in a shared space (the floor).
2. They both want the valuable thing and start arguing over it.
3. An external authority (Mrs. Lee) intervenes and divides the valuable thing evenly between them.
4. Betty and Norma realize their mistake and learn a lesson.

Comparing the two stories with the reference story, we can see that Story B is more analogous to the reference story. Both stories involve two individuals discovering something valuable, arguing over it, and having an external authority intervene to divide it. In both stories, the individuals learn a lesson and become friends or realize their mistake.

In Story A, the external authority does not divide the valuable thing but takes it for herself, which is not analogous to the reference story.

Therefore, the final answer is: <ans> B </ans>.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the key elements of the reference story (Ref):

1. The main character, Mrs. Jackson, is a teacher who wants a salary increase.
2. The principal announces a salary increase for himself but not for the teachers.
3. Mrs. Jackson becomes angry and takes revenge by setting fire to the principal's office and getting drunk.

Now, let's analyze the key elements of Story A:

1. The main character, McGhee, is a sailor who wants a few days of vacation on land.
2. The captain announces he will take a vacation in the mountains, but everyone else must remain on the ship.
3. McGhee becomes upset and takes revenge by blowing up the captain's cabin with dynamite.

And Story B:

1. The main character, McGhee, is a sailor who wants a few days of vacation on land.
2. McGhee tries to blow up the captain's cabin using dynamite, but the captain later announces he will take a vacation in the mountains, and everyone else must remain on board to repair the ship.

Comparing the key elements of the reference story and the two other stories, we can see that:

- Story A has a similar structure to the reference story, with a main character who wants something (vacation) and takes revenge when denied. However, the revenge action (blowing up the captain's cabin) is more extreme than in the reference story.
- Story B has a different structure, with the main character attempting revenge first and then the captain announcing his vacation plans. The revenge action (blowing up the captain's cabin) is the same as in Story A, but the timing and context are different.

Based on this analysis, the story that is most analogous to the reference story is:

<ans> A </ans>

Story A has a similar structure and key elements to the reference story, with a main character who wants something (vacation) and takes revenge when denied, followed by a more extreme revenge action (blowing up the captain's cabin).<|end_of_turn|>",,A,A

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the key elements of the reference story (Ref):

1. A cobra named Pierre is the main character.
2. The cobra encounters a falcon, leading to a conflict.
3. Both the cobra and the falcon are caught up in a series of events that ultimately result in their demise.
4. The setting of the story is an outdoor wedding ceremony.

Now, let's analyze the key elements of Story A:

1. Young Gene is the main character, a human.
2. Gene encounters a policeman, leading to a conflict.
3. Both Gene and the policeman are caught up in a series of events that ultimately result in their demise.
4. The setting of the story is on the road.

And Story B:

1. Young Gene is the main character, a human.
2. Gene encounters a policeman, leading to a conflict.
3. Both Gene and the policeman are caught up in a series of events that ultimately result in their demise.
4. The setting of the story is on the freeway.

Comparing the key elements of the reference story and the two other stories, we can see that:

- Story A has a human protagonist (Gene) and a policeman, while the reference story has a cobra (Pierre) and a falcon.
- Story B has a human protagonist (Gene) and a policeman, similar to Story A.
- Both Story A and Story B involve conflicts between the protagonist and the policeman, leading to their demise.
- The settings of the stories are different: the reference story takes place at an outdoor wedding ceremony, while Story A takes place on the road and Story B takes place on the freeway.

Based on these comparisons, we can conclude that Story A is more analogous to the reference story than Story B. Both involve a conflict between a human protagonist and a law enforcement figure, leading to their demise. The main difference is the setting, but the core elements of the story are more similar in Story A.

","First, let's analyze the key elements of the reference story (Ref):

1. A cobra named Pierre is the main character.
2. The cobra encounters a falcon, leading to a conflict.
3. Both the cobra and the falcon end up high in the sky, then fall and perish.
4. Their demise occurs in an unexpected location: an outdoor wedding ceremony.

Now, let's examine the key elements of Story A:

1. Young Gene is the main character, a human.
2. Gene encounters a policeman, leading to a conflict.
3. Both Gene and the policeman end up in a dangerous situation due to the policeman's dizziness.
4. They die in an unexpected location: hitting a wall.

And Story B:

1. Young Gene is the main character, a human.
2. Gene encounters a policeman, leading to a conflict.
3. Both Gene and the policeman end up in a dangerous situation due to the policeman's dizziness.
4. They die in an unexpected location: hitting a wall.

Comparing the key elements of the reference story and the two other stories, we can see that Story A has a more significant similarity to the reference story. Both involve a conflict between two characters (a cobra and a falcon in the reference story, and a boy and a policeman in Story A), followed by an unexpected and tragic outcome.

In contrast, Story B lacks the element of an unexpected location for the demise of the characters, which is a key aspect of the reference story.

Therefore, the final answer is: <ans> A </ans> as Story A is more analogous to the reference story.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,B
