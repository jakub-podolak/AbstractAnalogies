Let's think step by step.
","Both stories share some similarities, such as the protagonists' dislike of a particular situation (William in the psychiatric hospital, Karen in high school) and their strong desire for a reward (gingerbread for William, a trip to Hawaii for Karen). However, the key difference lies in the outcome of their efforts to achieve the reward.

In story A, Karen fails to graduate and does not get to go to Hawaii because she was too far behind in her classes and could not catch up in time. In story B, Karen also fails to graduate and does not go to Hawaii, but the reason is that she spent most of her time dreaming about the trip instead of focusing on her studies.

Given this information, the analogous story to the reference story is story B. In both stories, the protagonist fails to achieve the reward despite their best efforts, and in both cases, their failure is due to their inability to focus on the task at hand and instead giving in to their daydreams.</s>",<ans> B </ans></s>,B,A

","Both stories share some similarities, such as the protagonists' dislike for a particular situation (high school for Karen, confinement for William), their love for vacations, and the use of a reward as motivation. However, the key difference lies in the timing of the promised reward and the protagonists' ability to achieve it.

In Story A, the reward (a trip to Hawaii) was promised before the crucial period (the final weeks of school), and the protagonist failed to achieve it due to her poor performance during that period.

In Story B, the reward (a trip to Hawaii) was promised during the crucial period (the final weeks of school), and the protagonist failed to achieve it despite her best efforts.

Given this analysis, Story A is more analogous to the reference story. In the reference story, William was promised the gingerbread reward before the inspection, but he failed to achieve it due to his inability to clean his room in time.

In both stories, there is a new invention that can cause harm if not used properly. In story A, the person in charge (Ms. Boyce) initially considers the safety feature (warning label) unnecessary but changes her mind after experiencing an accident. In story B, the sequence of events is the same, but the order is reversed: the supplier recommends the safety feature after the accident. However, the crucial difference is that in story A, the person in charge was the one who initially resisted the safety feature, while in story B, it was the supplier. Given that the reference story is about Mr. Newton, who is a manager, the most analogous story is the one where the person in charge initially resists the safety feature, which is story A.</s>",,A,B

","Both stories share some similarities such as a man who likes to boast about having a spouse to provide for his needs, and that spouse not being able to provide for him on a particular day. However, the key difference lies in the number of spouses each man has before the incident.

Given this information, story A is not analogous to the reference story as the men's situations are not the same. Joseph's situation involves having only one chauffeur and hiring a second one, while Alexander's situation involves having only one wife and marrying a second one.

The government of Gagrach was very pleased. It promised never to attack Zerdia again.

Let's think step by step.
","In the reference story, Karla the hawk offers her feathers to the hunter in exchange for his promise not to shoot at hawks again. In story A, Zerdia sells its supercomputer to Gagrach in exchange for a promise of peace. In story B, Zerdia also sells its supercomputers to Gagrach after a failed attack, in exchange for a promise of peace.

Both stories involve a trade of valuable resources (hawk feathers in the reference story, supercomputers in stories A and B) in exchange for a promise of peace. However, the key difference is that in the reference story, the hunter initially tries to take the hawk's feathers by force, while in stories A and B, the trading of resources occurs before any hostilities.

Given this analysis, story B is more analogous to the reference story as it also involves a trade of resources for peace, even though the initial context is different (a trade before hostilities instead of after a failed attack).

Let's think step by step.
","Both stories involve a character or entity (Peter and Quiggly Company) making a decision based on a belief that they need to conform to a certain standard or trend (getting a tan to fit in in Florida, or entering the space manufacturing market for integrated circuits). However, they both end up suffering negative consequences as a result of their decisions (Peter getting second degree burns, Quiggly Company losing a lot of money).

The key difference between the two stories lies in the motivation behind their decisions. In the reference story, Peter's decision to get a tan is driven by his desire to fit in and be accepted by others. In contrast, in both versions of Story B, Quiggly Company's decision to enter the space manufacturing market is driven by their belief that they need to keep up with the competition and stay competitive in the market.

In Story A, Quiggly Company makes this decision without fully understanding the risks involved, much like Peter in the reference story who didn't realize how dangerous the sun could be. In Story B, Quiggly Company is aware of the risks but is annoyed at having to play it safe and decides to go against the advice of market analysts.

Given this analysis, the story that is most analogous to the reference story is Story A, where Quiggly Company makes a decision based on a misunderstanding of the risks involved, much like Peter's decision to get a tan without realizing the danger of the sun.

Let's think step by step.
","Both stories share some similarities such as the protagonist (Sam) traveling the world and buying things, and then visiting their mother in need of financial help. However, the reference story (Percy) includes the element of Percy singing for the squirrel in exchange for seeds.

Story A introduces a new element where Sam gives his mother a gift he bought in Tibet, but the mother's reaction is not mentioned in relation to Percy's singing.

Story B includes the mother's reaction to Sam's wasting of time, but it does not mention anything about Percy's singing or a gift being given in exchange for something.

Therefore, based on the provided information, neither story A nor story B is analogous to the reference story as they do not include the element of singing in exchange for something.

However, if we consider the context of the question and the fact that exactly one of the stories is analogous to the reference story, it is more likely that story B is the correct answer.

In story B, Sam's mother does not give him money and rejects the gift he brought from Tibet. However, she explicitly states that the gift is a ""piece of junk,"" which is not present in the reference story.

Let's think step by step.
","In the reference story, Boris and Ivan had a business partnership and there was an issue with Ivan's carelessness that led to the loss of money. Boris then took control of the financial matters. Later, Ivan made up for it by selling an expensive item to replace the lost money.

In Story A, John and Christine had a personal relationship and there was an issue with Christine's carelessness that led to the denting of John's car. John then took control of the car usage. No information is given about Christine making up for it.

In Story B, John and Christine had a personal relationship and there was an issue with Christine's reckless driving. John then took control of the car usage. Christine, in response, intentionally dented John's car.

The key difference between the reference story and Story A is that in the reference story, Ivan made up for his mistake and Boris forgave him, while in Story B, Christine intentionally caused further damage after John took control of the car usage.

Therefore, based on the given information, Story A is not analogous to the reference story. Story B, on the other hand, shows a similar dynamic of one partner causing an issue and the other partner taking control, but it also includes an element of revenge that is not present in the reference story. However, the presence of this additional element does not necessarily make Story B less analogous, as the reference story also involves a resolution and forgiveness. Ultimately, the decision of which story is more analogous depends on the specific criteria being used for analysis.

Based on the given information, it is difficult to definitively determine which story is more analogous to the reference story. However, if the focus is on the similarities between the stories, then Story B may be considered more analogous due to the similar dynamic of one partner causing an issue and the other partner taking control. If the focus is on the differences between the stories, then Story A may be considered less analogous due to the lack of a resolution or forgiveness.

Therefore, the final answer is: <ans> B </ans> or <ans> A </ans>, depending on the specific criteria being used for analysis.</s>",<ans> B </ans></s>,B,A

","Both stories involve a couple, one partner causing an issue that leads to the other partner restricting their actions. However, the causes and consequences are different.

In the reference story, Boris and Ivan's business partnership is affected by Ivan's carelessness with money. Boris, in response, takes control of the financial matters. Later, Ivan makes amends by selling a valuable item to replace the lost funds.

In Story A, John and Christine's relationship is affected by Christine's reckless driving. John, in response, restricts her from driving his car. Christine, in a fit of anger, damages the car.

In Story B, Christine's reckless driving damages John's car accidentally. John, in response, restricts her from driving his car.

The key difference lies in the cause of the restriction. In the reference story, the restriction is a result of Boris's response to Ivan's carelessness. In Story A, the restriction is a direct consequence of Christine's actions.

In Story B, the cause of the restriction is more similar to the reference story, as it is a response to an unintended incident. Therefore, the answer is:

","Both stories involve two smaller entities (Bolon/Salam or Lincoln and Moreland) facing a larger, threatening entity (Mayonia or Chad). In both cases, one of the smaller entities tries to make a deal with the larger entity to ensure their own survival. However, the larger entity ultimately overpowers both smaller entities and takes control.

The key difference between the stories lies in the initial actions of the smaller entities. In the reference story, Bolon tries to take over Salam, while in stories A and B, Moreland tries to protect Lincoln but ultimately fails.

Given this analysis, it's less likely that story A is analogous to the reference story, as the initial actions of the smaller entities are not similar. In the reference story, Bolon is the aggressor, while in story A, Moreland is trying to protect himself and Lincoln.

Let's think step by step.
","Both stories share some similarities, such as an obsessive character (Cornelius) who neglects their domestic responsibilities in favor of their passion (astronomy or bridge rebuilding), and a resulting accident that injures them and makes them realize the importance of balancing their time and resources.

However, the key difference between the two stories lies in the reactions of the respective characters' partners (chamberlain and Agatha) to their neglect. In story A, Agatha complains about the neglected house and Cornelius listens and makes a change. In story B, Agatha complains about the neglected house but Cornelius does not listen until the accident occurs.

Given this difference, the analogous story to the reference story is story B, as it more closely mirrors the dynamic between Otto and the chamberlain. In the reference story, the chamberlain complains about the neglected bridges and Otto does not listen until the accident occurs.</s>",<ans> B </ans></s>,B,A

","Both stories share some similarities such as the unexpected appearance of a threatening figure (lion in Ref, beggar in A/B), the protagonist's initial fear and attempt to escape (giving away a valuable possession in Ref, throwing money in A/B), and the realization that they have lost something valuable after the threat has left (a lamb in Ref, a bag of coins in A/B).

However, the key difference lies in the sequence of events. In the reference story, the protagonist gives away the valuable possession (a lamb) before the threat (lion) takes anything.

In the reference story, Frederick willingly gave up a lamb to save himself and his flock, while in both versions of Story B, Zebediah threw the money to the threatening figure in order to escape.

Given this information, it is more likely that Story A is analogous to the reference story. In both stories, the protagonist is forced to make a difficult decision to save themselves and their possessions, and in both cases, they end up losing one of their possessions. The fact that Frederick gave up a lamb voluntarily while Zebediah threw the money out of fear does not change the fundamental similarity between the two stories.

In Story B, however, Lee takes the money for herself and neither Betty nor Norma gets a chance to divide it between them. This outcome is not present in the reference story or Story A.

Let's think step by step.
","Both stories have some similarities, such as two people discovering something valuable and arguing over it. However, the key difference lies in the resolution of the conflict.

In the reference story, the conflict is resolved by an external authority figure (Sheriff Jones) who divides the land evenly between Smith and Johnson. In Story B, the conflict is also resolved by an external authority figure (Mrs. Lee), but the outcome is the same: the land (or money) is divided between the two disputants.

However, in Story A, the conflict is not resolved in a way that benefits both parties. Instead, an external figure (Lee) takes the money for herself, leaving Betty and Norma empty-handed.

Therefore, based on the provided information, Story B is the analogous story to the reference story. Both stories involve two people disputing over something valuable, and an external authority figure resolving the conflict by dividing the valuable item evenly between them. In both stories, the disputants realize that they should have divided the item themselves.</s>",<ans> B </ans></s>,B,B

Let's think step by step.
","Both stories involve a character (Mrs. Jackson in Ref, McGhee in A/B) who feels they have been unfairly treated and decide to take revenge. However, the key difference lies in the cause and effect sequence of events.

In Ref, the principal announces his salary increase first, and Mrs. Jackson's anger leads her to take revenge. In contrast, in Story A, McGhee's desire for vacation and his decision to blow up the captain's cabin are presented as separate events. The captain's vacation announcement comes after the incident.

In Story B, the sequence of events is similar to Ref, with McGhee's desire for vacation leading to his decision to blow up the captain's cabin, and the captain's vacation announcement coming afterward.

Given this analysis, the answer is: <ans> B </ans>. Story B is analogous to the reference story as both involve the character's desire leading to their decision to take revenge, followed by the announcement of an event that may have been the initial cause of their anger.</s>",,B,A

","Both stories involve a character (Mrs. Jackson in Ref and McGhee in A/B) who feels frustrated or angry about not receiving something they desire (salary increase for Mrs. Jackson and vacation days for McGhee). In response, they both take extreme measures to seek revenge against the person denying them (principal in Ref and captain in A/B).

However, the key difference lies in the timing of the events. In the reference story, the principal announces his own salary increase before denying the teachers, while in stories A and B, the captain announces his vacation plans before denying the sailors their own time off.

Let's think step by step.
","Both stories share some similarities such as a young boy (Gene) being involved in an incident with a law enforcement officer (policeman), resulting in their deaths. However, the reference story involves a cobra and a falcon, while Story A and Story B both involve a boy and a policeman.

To determine which story is analogous to the reference story, we need to find the underlying similarities beyond the surface-level details. In the reference story, the cobra strikes the falcon out of fear, and they both end up dying due to unintended consequences. In Story A and Story B, Gene hits the policeman, and they both die due to the policeman's inability to drive safely.

However, there is a crucial difference between the two sets of events. In the reference story, the cobra and the falcon do not have any prior relationship or interaction, and their encounter is a random event. In contrast, in Story A and Story B, Gene intentionally harms the policeman, leading to their deaths.

Therefore, based on the given information, Story A and Story B are not analogous to the reference story. The underlying themes and causes of the events are different.

Let's think step by step.
","Both stories share some similarities such as a young boy (Gene) being involved in an unexpected encounter with a law enforcement figure (policeman), resulting in injury or incapacitation to one or both parties, leading to an unfortunate accident and death. However, the reference story involves a cobra and a falcon, while story A and B involve a boy and a policeman.

To determine which story is analogous to the reference story, we need to find the underlying theme or moral that connects them. In the reference story, the cobra and the falcon represent two opposing forces in nature, and the story illustrates the unintended consequences of fear and aggression.

In stories A and B, the boy and the policeman also represent two opposing forces, but the underlying theme is different. The stories do not illustrate the unintended consequences of fear and aggression between two natural forces but rather the unfortunate consequences of a boy's fear and panic towards a law enforcement figure.

Therefore, none of the stories A or B are analogous to the reference story. They share some superficial similarities but have different underlying themes and moral messages.
