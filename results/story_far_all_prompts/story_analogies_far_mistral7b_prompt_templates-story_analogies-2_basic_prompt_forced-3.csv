Explanation: Both stories share similar elements such as the protagonist's dislike for a particular situation (William in the psychiatric hospital and Karen in high school), their love for something that seems unattainable due to their current situation (William's gingerbread and Karen's trip to Hawaii), and their failure to achieve their goal despite their best efforts. However, the key difference lies in the fact that in Story A, Karen's failure to graduate was due to her excessive daydreaming about Hawaii, while in Story B, Karen's failure to graduate was not explicitly stated to be caused by her daydreaming about Hawaii. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the reference story as it more closely mirrors the cause-and-effect relationship between William's daydreaming and his failure to pass the room inspections.</s>",,A,A

Explanation: Both stories involve individuals (William and Karen) who have a strong desire for something (gingerbread for William, a trip to Hawaii for Karen) that is contingent upon meeting certain requirements (passing room inspections for William, passing classes to graduate for Karen). However, in both cases, the individuals fail to meet the requirements and therefore do not obtain the desired reward. The key difference between the stories lies in the fact that in Story A, the promise of the reward (trip to Hawaii) was made before the individual began to fall behind, while in Story B, the promise was made after the individual had already fallen behind. Given this difference, it is more reasonable to conclude that Story A is analogous to the reference story, as in both cases the individuals were motivated by the promise of a reward but ultimately failed to obtain it due to their own actions.</s>",,A,B

Explanation: In both stories, a new product is introduced that has the potential to cause harm if not used properly. In one story (A), the person in charge initially disregards the recommendation for a safety feature (warning label), but later experiences an accident that changes their mind. In the other story (B), the person in charge also experiences an accident and then implements the safety feature.

Explanation: In both stories, there is a valuable resource (hawk feathers in Ref, computers in A/B) that is desired by another entity (hunter in Ref, Gagrach in A/B). In the reference story, the hawk offers the resource to the hunter in exchange for peace. In Story A, Zerdia sells its computers to Gagrach to secure peace. The key difference is that in the reference story, the hunter's intentions were initially hostile, but he changed his mind after receiving the resource. In Story A, Zerdia willingly sells the resource, and the outcome is still peace. Therefore, Story A is analogous to the reference story. Story B is not analogous as it describes a situation where Zerdia's computers were used against it, resulting in an attack rather than peace.</s>",,A,A

In both stories, there is a valuable resource (hawk feathers in Ref, computers in A/B) that is desired by another entity (hunter in Ref, Gagrach in A/B). In the Ref story, the hawk offers the resource to the hunter in exchange for a promise not to harm the hawk. In Story B, the country Zerdia offers its computers to Gagrach in exchange for a promise not to attack Zerdia. The key difference is that in the Ref story, the hunter initially tries to take the resource by force, while in Story B, Gagrach initially tries to take the resource by force but ultimately accepts the offer to buy it instead. However, the essential similarity is that in both cases, the offering of the resource leads to a peaceful resolution.

In Story A, the situation is different. Zerdia sells a supercomputer to Gagrach, but later discovers that Gagrach used the supercomputer to guide missiles against Zerdia. This is not an analogous situation to the Ref story, as there is no peaceful resolution or offer of resources in exchange for a promise not to harm.

Explanation: In both stories, the main character (Peter in Ref and Quiggly Company in A/B) face a situation where they feel pressured to conform to a certain standard (Peter wanting to tan like everyone else in Florida and Quiggly Company wanting to have sophisticated space factories to compete in the integrated circuit market). However, they underestimate the risks and consequences of their actions (Peter getting severely sunburned and Quiggly Company overspending and losing money). In the end, they both realize their mistakes and decide to abandon their initial plans and return to their previous ways (Peter leaving Florida and Quiggly Company going back to making conventional electrical components).

However, in story A, the character dismisses the value of the desired object before learning its true cost, while in story B, the character is willing to buy the object to test her hypothesis about its quality.

Explanation: In both stories, the protagonist (Percy and Sam) visit someone (a squirrel and a mother) expecting to receive something in return for a gift or a song.

Explanation: Both stories share similar elements such as the protagonist traveling and buying things, running out of money, and visiting their mother for help. However, in the reference story, Percy sings for the squirrel in exchange for sunflower seeds, while in stories A and B, Sam gives his mother a gift in hopes of receiving a loan. The key difference lies in the reason for the mother's displeasure. In the reference story, the mother is a squirrel, and Percy's singing is the issue.

Explanation: In both stories, there is a business partnership between two individuals (Boris and Ivan, John and Christine) and an issue arises due to one partner's recklessness (Ivan throwing out cash, Christine denting the car). The other partner then imposes a restriction on the reckless partner (Ivan not handling money, Christine not driving the car). However, in Story A, the reckless action (denting the car) precedes the restriction, while in Story B, the restriction precedes the reckless action. In the reference story, the reckless action (Ivan throwing out cash) also precedes the restriction (Boris not letting Ivan handle money). Therefore, Story B is the analogous story.</s>",,B,B

Explanation: In both stories, there is a character (Morris in Ref and Jenny in A/B) who is told to do something differently but ignores the advice and ends up in trouble. However, the key similarity lies in the fact that the character mistakenly believes that the advice was to do the opposite of what was actually suggested. In the reference story, Morris believes his cellmate wanted him to play harmonica at night, while in story A, Jenny believes it's bad luck to play in her own yard. In story B, there is no such misunderstanding, as the neighbor explicitly tells Jenny to play in her own yard. Therefore, story A is the analogous one to the reference story.</s>",,A,B

Explanation: The key similarities between the reference story and both stories A and B are the obsession of the main character with their respective fields, the neglect of domestic matters due to this obsession, and the resulting injury that makes the main character realize the importance of balancing their time between their obsession and domestic responsibilities. However, in story A, the main character's wife is the one who initially raises concerns about the neglect of domestic matters, while in story B, it is the main character himself who realizes the importance of balancing his time after the injury. The reference story also mentions the abandonment of a project (rebuilding the bridges) due to the obsession with military campaigns, which is not present in either story A or B. Therefore, based on the given information, story A is the more analogous story to the reference story.</s>",,A,B

Explanation: Both stories share similar elements such as a protagonist being frightened by an unexpected intruder, giving something valuable to the intruder to escape, and later discovering that a valuable item is missing. However, in Story A, the intruder is a beggar, while in Story B, the intruder appears after the valuable item has already been given away. In the reference story, the intruder is a lion, which is an analogous character to the beggar in Story A, as both are wild animals that pose a threat to the protagonist. Therefore, Story A is the analogous story to the reference story.</s>",,A,A

In Story A, the interruption causes a tragedy (the loss of the eggs), while in Story B, the tragedy (the loss of the sleeping bags) occurs after the interruption.

Return only the final answer.","<ans> A </ans>

Explanation: The key similarity between the reference story and Story A is that both Mrs. Jackson and McGhee became angry and sought revenge due to feeling unfairly treated by their respective authorities (principal and captain) who were able to secure a personal benefit for themselves while denying the same to the protagonists. In Story B, the timing of McGhee's revenge does not align with the principal's salary announcement in the reference story.</s>",,A,B
