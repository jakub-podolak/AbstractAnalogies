Explanation: Both stories share similar elements such as the protagonist's dislike for a particular situation (William in the psychiatric hospital, Karen in high school) and their desire for a reward (gingerbread for William, a trip to Hawaii for Karen). However, the key difference lies in the fact that in Story A, Karen's failure to meet the requirement for the reward was due to her inability to focus on her studies, while in Story B, Karen's failure was due to her lack of effort and focus on passing her classes. In the reference story, William's failure to pass the inspection was also due to his lack of effort in cleaning his room. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the reference story as both protagonists failed to achieve their rewards due to their own actions or inactions.</s>",,A,A

Explanation: Both stories involve individuals (William and Karen) who have a strong desire for something (gingerbread for William, a trip to Hawaii for Karen) that is contingent upon meeting certain requirements (passing room inspections for William, passing classes to graduate for Karen). However, in both cases, the individuals fail to meet the requirements and therefore do not obtain the desired reward. The key difference between the stories is that in Story A, the promise of the reward (trip to Hawaii) serves as a motivator for the individual to put in effort towards meeting the requirements, while in Story B, the promise of the reward comes after the individual has already failed to meet the requirements. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to the reference story as it illustrates the use of a reward as a motivator that unfortunately does not materialize due to the individual's failure to meet the requirements.</s>",,A,B

Explanation: In both stories, a new product with improved features is introduced, and an incident occurs where the person in charge is injured. In response, a safety feature (warning label) is recommended and implemented. However, the key difference is that in Story A, the person in charge initially considered the safety feature unnecessary before the incident, while in Story B, the safety feature was recommended and implemented directly after the incident, without any prior consideration of its necessity. Therefore, Story A is the analogous story to the reference story, as it follows the same sequence of events: the introduction of a new product, an injury occurring, and the implementation of a safety feature in response.</s>",,A,B

Ref: Peter was a young man from Iceland who moved to Florida one summer. He was very self-conscious about his fair skin. Peter thought that people would not accept him unless he tanned himself golden-brown like every one else.
So Peter spent a whole day in the sun, trying to get a tan. He didn't understand how dangerous the sun could be. Consequently, by evening he had second degree burns over most of his body and he had to go to the hospital. Peter decided that Florida was not for him and booked the next ocean liner back to Iceland.

Explanation: In both stories, the main character (Peter in Ref and Quiggly Company in A/B) face a situation where they feel pressured to conform to a certain standard (Peter wanting to tan like everyone else in Florida and Quiggly Company wanting to have sophisticated space factories to compete in the integrated circuit market). However, they underestimate the risks and consequences of their actions (Peter getting severely sunburned and Quiggly Company overspending and losing money). In the end, they both realize their mistakes and decide to abandon their initial plans and return to their previous ways (Peter leaving Florida and Quiggly Company going back to making conventional electrical components).

Explanation: In both stories, the main character (Peter in Ref and Quiggly Company in A/B) face a situation where they are tempted to follow a trend or path that seems desirable but turns out to be risky or harmful. In Ref, Peter tries to get a tan like everyone else in Florida, ignoring the danger of sunburns. In A/B, Quiggly Company enters the integrated circuit market and believes they need sophisticated space factories to compete, leading them to financial ruin. The outcome in both cases is that the main character realizes their mistake and decides to abandon the risky path and return to their previous way of doing things. Therefore, Story B is analogous to the reference story.</s>",,B,B

Explanation: Both stories involve a character desiring an object (Julius wanting pears, Cindy wanting records) but being unable to obtain it due to financial constraints. The key difference lies in the reason why the characters are disappointed - Julius is disappointed because he cannot reach the pears, while Cindy in Story A is disappointed because she cannot afford them. In Story B, Cindy has already given up on the records and is no longer disappointed, instead expressing a belief that they would be boring even if she could afford them. However, the reference story does not indicate that Julius has given up on the pears or has any reason to believe they would be rotten other than his initial observation. Therefore, Story A is the more analogous one as it shares the same basic structure of desire, inability to obtain, and subsequent disappointment.</s>",,A,A

Explanation: In both stories, the main character (Percy/Sam) visits someone (squirrel/mother) expecting to receive something in return for a gift or a song. However, the person is disappointed and refuses to give the main character what they are asking for. The key difference between the stories lies in the reason for the disappointment.

Explanation: Both stories share similar elements such as the protagonist traveling and running out of money, but the reference story specifically mentions singing and receiving seeds in return. Story A also involves the protagonist giving a gift in hopes of receiving something in return, which is similar to Percy singing for the squirrel. However, in Story B, the mother explicitly calls the gift a ""piece of junk,"" which is not present in the reference story.

Therefore, while not an exact match, Story B comes closer to being analogous to the reference story than Story A, as it shares the theme of trust and redemption.

In Story A, the weaker party (Moreland) tries to make a deal with the stronger party (Chad) to save himself, but ultimately fails and is robbed along with the other party (Lincoln). In Story B, the weaker party (Moreland) willingly helps the stronger party (Chad) rob the other party (Lincoln), and is then robbed himself due to his exhaustion.

However, the reference story (Bolon and Salam) involves international politics and power dynamics, while Stories A and B are about interpersonal conflicts between children. The analogy between the reference story and one of the other stories is not immediately apparent.

Story A: Cornelius was an astronomer who thought about nothing but astronomy. He was obsessed with stars and galaxies.
His wife Agatha complained that he was spending too much time on astronomy and not enough on maintaining his own house. As a result, the roof was gradually leaking more and more and the house was becoming almost unlivable. But Cornelius would not listen.
Then, one evening when Cornelius was walking through his house, a rotten floor collapsed under his weight. Cornelius was severely injured but the accident showed him that Agatha had been right all along. He decided to try to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.

Story B: Cornelius was an astronomer who thought about nothing but astronomy. He was obsessed with stars and galaxies. Gradually he was turning his home into an observatory.
But before he was finished his wife Agatha complained that he was spending too much time renovating the house and not enough on his job which was astronomy. As a result, the house was no longer livable. Cornelius decided that Agatha was right and he went back to thinking about nothing but astronomy.
Then, one evening when Cornelius was walking through his house, an unfinished floor collapsed under his weight. Cornelius was severely injured but the accident showed him that he should try to balance his time between astronomy and maintaining his home.

The key similarity between the reference story and Story A is that both kings (King Otto and Cornelius) were obsessed with their respective interests (war and astronomy) to the point of neglecting important domestic matters (bridge construction and house maintenance), leading to accidents that caused injuries and made them realize the importance of balancing their interests. In Story B, the outcome of Cornelius's accident leads him to the same realization, but the sequence of events (abandoning house renovations before the accident) is different from the reference story and Story A. Therefore, Story A is the analogous story.</s>",,A,B

Explanation: Both stories share similar elements such as a protagonist being frightened by an unexpected intruder, giving something valuable to the intruder to escape, and later discovering that a valuable item is missing. However, in Story A, the intruder is a beggar who was attracted by the protagonist's shouting, while in Story B, the intruder is a thief who was drawn by the missing bag of coins. The key difference lies in the sequence of events. In Story A, the protagonist starts yelling to scare away the beggar, who then takes the opportunity to approach and steal a bag of coins. In Story B, the protagonist wakes up to find a bag of coins missing and then encounters the beggar, who is not mentioned as taking anything until after Zebediah throws a second bag of coins to him. Therefore, Story A is the analogous story to the reference story as it follows the same sequence of events: the protagonist's actions attract the intruder, who then takes an opportunity to steal a valuable item.</s>",,A,A

Explanation: In both stories, there is a person (Mark in Ref and Linda in A/B) who is trying to solve a problem or figure something out, but is interrupted or attacked by the people they are responsible for (chickens in Ref and girl scouts in A/B). In Story A, the interruption causes a tragedy (the loss of the eggs), while in Story B, the tragedy (the loss of the sleeping bags) occurs after the interruption. However, the key similarity is that the interruption and the tragedy are linked, and the person is left to deal with the aftermath while being criticized or attacked by those they are responsible for. In Story A, the girl scouts attack their director after they return and find their sleeping bags missing, while in Ref, the chickens attack Mark after they return and find him in the henhouse.

Explanation: The key similarity between the reference story and Story A is that both Mrs. Jackson and McGhee became angry and sought revenge due to feeling unfairly treated by their respective authorities (principal and captain) who were able to secure personal benefits while denying similar benefits to others.

Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>.","<ans> Both A and B have similar elements of a character being taken against their will by an authority figure, resulting in an unfortunate accident leading to their demise. However, the reference story involves a cobra and a falcon, while stories A and B involve a boy and a policeman. The key similarity lies in the unexpected and unfortunate consequences of their actions.

Given the provided information, it is not possible to definitively determine which story is analogous to the reference story based on the information provided alone. However, if we consider the underlying themes of fear, authority, and unintended consequences, all three stories share similarities.

Therefore, based on the given information, it is impossible to determine which story is analogous to the reference story with certainty. However, if we consider the broader themes and similarities, all three stories can be seen as analogous in some way.

So, the final answer is: <ans> Both A and B </ans> (are analogous to the reference story, given the broader themes and similarities).</s>","<ans> Both A and B </ans> (are analogous to the reference story, given the broader themes and similarities).</s>",,A
