Story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, the main character struggles with their current situation (William with his messy room and poor hygiene, Karen with her poor academic performance), and they are motivated by a promise of a reward (gingerbread for William, a trip to Hawaii for Karen). However, despite their efforts and happiness about the potential reward, they ultimately fail to achieve their goal and do not receive the promised reward. The structure and themes of the two stories are more closely aligned than with Story A, which focuses on Karen's daydreaming about vacation rather than her academic performance and the consequences of her actions.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

Story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, the main character (William in the source story and Karen in Story B) struggles with their current situation (being confined in a psychiatric hospital and doing poorly in high school, respectively). They both spend a lot of time daydreaming about something they desire (food and a trip to Hawaii, respectively). A promise is made to motivate them (gingerbread for a clean room and a trip to Hawaii for passing classes), but due to their inability to change their situation in time, they do not achieve their desired outcome.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

Story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, a new product with increased intensity (sharpness in the source story and heat in Story B) leads to an accident that alarms the manager (Mr. Newton in the source story and Ms. Boyce in Story B). As a result, they both consider safety features (safety razor in the source story and warning labels in Story B) absolutely necessary and implement them immediately. The main difference is the initial reaction of the characters to the safety feature recommendation, but the overall structure and progression of events are similar.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

# Source Story:
Peter was a young man from Iceland who moved to Florida one summer. He was very self-conscious about his fair skin. Peter thought that people would not accept him unless he tanned himself golden-brown like every one else.
So Peter spent a whole day in the sun, trying to get a tan. He didn't understand how dangerous the sun could be. Consequently, by evening he had second degree burns over most of his body and he had to go to the hospital. Peter decided that Florida was not for him and booked the next ocean liner back to Iceland. He spent the whole trip under a large umbrella keeping cool.

# Story A:
Quiggly Company was as small company that manufactured electrical components. One, year, Quiggly Co. began to get into the integrated circuit market. However, Quiggly Company felt that to be competitive it would have to have really sophisticated space factories, as did all the other manufacturers of integrated circuits. Thus, Quiggly put all its assets into having a space factory. The company just didn't realize what a financial risk space manufacturing was. As a result, within six months, Quiggly Company had spent much more than they could afford and their stocks plunged to an all time low. .Quiggly Co. decided to pull out of integrated circuits altogether and went back to making conventional electrical components.

Story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, the main character (Peter in the source story and Quiggly Company in Story B) is influenced by the actions of others and the desire to fit in or keep up with the competition. They both take a risk without fully understanding the consequences, leading to negative outcomes (Peter's sunburn and Quiggly Company's financial loss). In contrast, Story A does not share these same elements, as Quiggly Company in that story is warned about the risks and still chooses to proceed, which is not reflected in the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

Story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, the protagonist (Peter in the source story and Quiggly Company in Story B) takes a risky action (tanning in the sun and investing in space manufacturing, respectively) based on the belief that they need to conform to what everyone else is doing. In both cases, the protagonist underestimates the potential dangers or costs of their actions, leading to negative consequences (severe sunburns and financial ruin for Quiggly Company). In contrast, Story A does not share these same elements and is therefore not as analogous to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

Story A is more analogous to the source story because both involve a character (Julius in the source story and Cindy in Story A) who is interested in obtaining something (pears in the source story and records in Story A) but is unable to do so due to a perceived issue (rotten pears and high price of records). Both characters also experience disappointment as a result of their inability to obtain the desired item.

# Source Story:
Two small countries, Bolon and Salam, were adjacent to a large, warlike country called Mayonia.
Bolon decided to make the best of the situation by taking over Salam. Salam started looking for aid from other strong countries but soon Bolon succeeded in taking it over.
Then victorious Bolon proposed to make a treaty with its warlike neighbor Mayonia. Bolon proposed to give Mayonia control over Salam in exchange for a guarantee that Bolon would remain independent.
Mayonia responded by overrunning both Bolon and Salam. Bolon was so busy maintaining control of Salam, it could do nothing to stop Mayonia. Therupon, Mayonia installed puppet governments in both Bolon and Salam, and took over the newspapers and radio stations.

Story B is more analogous to the source story because both involve a weaker party (Bolon/Lincoln) trying to make the best of a dangerous situation by aligning with a stronger, antagonistic party (Salam/Moreland) only to be betrayed by them and ultimately overpowered by the third, dominant party (Mayonia/Chad). In both stories, the weaker parties are unable to prevent the ultimate takeover due to their preoccupation with dealing with the immediate threat.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

Story B is more analogous to the source story because it shares the following key elements:

1. Two smaller entities (Bolon and Salam in the source story, Lincoln and Moreland in Story B) are in a vulnerable situation due to the presence of a larger, more powerful entity (Mayonia in the source story, Chad in Story B).
2. The smaller entities try to make the best of the situation by making a deal with the larger entity (Bolon proposing a treaty with Mayonia, Moreland offering to help Chad rob Lincoln).
3. Despite their efforts, the smaller entities are ultimately overpowered by the larger entity (Mayonia overrunning Bolon and Salam, Chad robbing both Lincoln and Moreland).

In both stories, the smaller entities' attempts to protect themselves by making deals with the larger entity fail, and they end up being controlled or harmed by the larger entity.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

Story A is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, a character values a particular item (an apricot tree in the source story and a canary in Story A) above all the rest. Both items become ill and stop producing their wonderful fruit or songs, causing disappointment among those who enjoyed them. In both stories, a person who appreciates the item decides to buy it, move it to their own place, and take care of it. As a result, the item starts producing its wonderful fruit or songs again, winning recognition and praise. In contrast, Story B has a negative outcome where the canary becomes fatally ill after being moved, which is not present in the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,A

Story A is more analogous to the source story because both involve a character who is obsessed with one aspect of their life (King Otto with conquest and riches, Cornelius with astronomy) and neglects another important aspect (King Otto with domestic expenditures, Cornelius with maintaining his home). In both stories, a mishap (King Otto's carriage crashing through an unfinished bridge, Cornelius's floor collapsing) leads to a realization that they need to balance their priorities. This is not the case in Story B, where Cornelius returns to his obsession with astronomy after his wife's complaint, instead of learning a lesson about balance.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,B

Story A is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, the main character (Frederick in the source story and Zebediah in Story A) is faced with a dangerous situation (a lion and a beggar, respectively) and tries to escape by giving the threat something of value (a lamb and a bag of coins, respectively). Both characters then discover that their actions did not completely resolve the situation, as another member of their flock or possessions is missing. The structure and themes of the two stories are more similar than those of Story B, which has a different sequence of events and does not involve the same kind of conflict resolution.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,A

Story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, a conflict arises between two characters (Pierre and the falcon in the source story, Gene and the policeman in Story B), leading to a dangerous situation. In both stories, the characters end up in a perilous situation due to their actions (Pierre wounding the falcon, Gene hitting the policeman), and ultimately, they both meet a tragic end (plummeting to the ground and perishing, running off the road and hitting a wall). The structure and themes of the two stories are more similar than those of Story A, which involves a different sequence of events and lacks the parallel between the characters' actions and their consequences.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

Story B is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, a conflict arises between two characters (a cobra and a falcon in the source story, and a boy and a policeman in Story B). The conflict leads to a dangerous situation, and both pairs end up in a fatal accident. Additionally, the source story and Story B both involve a lesson or consequence for the characters involved. In the source story, the falcon teaches Pierre a lesson by carrying him away, and in Story B, the policeman tries to set Gene straight by taking him away.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B
