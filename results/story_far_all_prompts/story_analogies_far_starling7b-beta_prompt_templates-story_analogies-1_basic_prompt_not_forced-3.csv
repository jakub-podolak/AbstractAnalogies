Story B is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). Both stories share the following similarities:

1. The protagonists, William and Karen, both struggle academically and have difficulty maintaining a clean or organized living space.
2. They both have a strong desire for something external (gingerbread for William, a trip to Hawaii for Karen) as a reward for improving their situation.
3. Despite their efforts and excitement, they both fail to achieve their goals due to insufficient time and effort spent on their tasks.
4. The external rewards are not achieved, leading to disappointment and frustration for the characters.

While Story A also has some similarities with the reference story, it lacks the key element of the external reward being tied to the protagonist's academic performance, which is a central theme in both the reference story and Story B.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

Story A is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). Both stories involve a manager (Mr. Newton in Ref and Ms. Boyce in A) who experiences an accident due to a new product (sharp razor in Ref and intense heat lamp in A) that their company has developed. In both cases, the accident leads to the recommendation of a safety feature (safety razor in Ref and warning label in A) that the manager initially considers unnecessary but later deems absolutely necessary after the incident.

Story B is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). In both stories, a new product with enhanced capabilities is introduced (sharp metal in Ref, intense heat filament in Story B). In both cases, an incident involving the person in charge of the product (Mr. Newton in Ref, Ms. Boyce in Story B) leads to a recommendation for a safety feature (safety razor in Ref, warning label in Story B). Finally, both individuals consider the safety feature necessary after the incident and take immediate action to implement it. The main difference between the two stories is the order of events, but the overall structure and themes are similar.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

Story A is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). In both stories, a powerful entity (the hunter in Ref and Gagrach in A) attempts to take something valuable from a weaker entity (Karla the hawk in Ref and Zerdia in A). However, the attempt fails, and instead of continuing the conflict, the powerful entity agrees to a peaceful resolution after receiving a portion of what they initially sought.

Story B is the analogous story to the reference story. In both stories, the main character (Peter in the reference story and Quiggly Company in Story B) is influenced by the perception that everyone else is doing something (getting a tan or investing in space manufacturing) and decides to follow suit despite warnings about the potential dangers or risks involved. In both cases, the characters face negative consequences (Peter's severe sunburn and Quiggly Company's financial loss) as a result of their decisions. Story A, on the other hand, does not follow this pattern as closely, as the company's decision to invest in space manufacturing is not driven by the same kind of social pressure as in the reference and Story B.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

Story B is the analogous story to the reference story. In both stories, the main character (Peter in the reference story and Quiggly Company in Story B) is faced with a situation where they feel pressured to conform to the actions of others (Peter tanning like everyone else in Florida, and Quiggly Company building a space factory like other integrated circuit manufacturers). Both characters underestimate the risks involved in their decisions (sun exposure for Peter, and the financial risk of space manufacturing for Quiggly Company) and end up facing negative consequences (Peter with severe sunburns and a hospital visit, and Quiggly Company with plummeting stocks and financial difficulties). In the end, both characters decide to abandon their risky endeavors and return to their original pursuits (Peter leaving Florida and Quiggly Company going back to manufacturing conventional electrical components).<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

The story that is analogous to the reference story is Story B. In both the reference story and Story B, the main character (Julius the mule and Cindy the girl) encounters something they desire (pears and records, respectively) but are unable to obtain due to their high cost or inaccessibility. Both characters then experience disappointment as a result of their inability to satisfy their desires. The structure and themes of these two stories are more similar than those of Story A, which focuses on the girl's perception of the records' value rather than her inability to afford them.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

This annoyed Boris who therefore demanded that Ivan have nothing to do with the monetary matters of their new store. Later, however, Ivan redeemed himself by selling his fancy new stereo set to replace the lost cash.

Story B is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). In both stories, the characters John and Christine are in a relationship and decide to get married. In both stories, Christine's recklessness causes an issue with John's new possession (cash in the reference story, car in Story B). As a result, John insists that Christine should not handle the new possession. The main difference is the specific incident that triggers the conflict (lost cash in the reference story, dented car in Story B), but the overall structure and theme of the stories are similar.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

Story B is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). In both stories, there is a power dynamic between the characters, with one character attempting to manipulate the situation to their advantage. In the reference story, Bolon tries to appease Mayonia by offering control over Salam, but ultimately fails as Mayonia overpowers both Bolon and Salam. Similarly, in Story B, Moreland tries to manipulate the situation by overpowering Lincoln and offering Chad the chance to rob Lincoln in exchange for being left alone, but Chad robs both of them anyway.

Story A is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). Both stories involve a person valuing a particular pet (an apricot tree in the reference story and a canary in Story A) above all others and sharing its gifts with others. In both stories, the beloved pet faces a crisis (the apricot tree withering and the canary becoming ill), but is ultimately saved and returned to good health by a new caretaker who appreciates its value. In Story B, the canary becomes ill and dies after being moved, which is not the case in the reference story where the apricot tree thrives in its new location.

Story A is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). In both stories, the main character (King Otto in Ref and Cornelius in A) is obsessed with one aspect of their life (conquest and riches for Otto, and astronomy for Cornelius) to the neglect of other important areas (domestic expenditures and home maintenance, respectively). In both stories, a mishap (bridge collapse in Ref, house collapse in A) leads to a realization that balance is needed in their lives. After the incident, both characters decide to balance their interests and make changes accordingly. While Story B also involves Cornelius and his obsession with astronomy, the story's focus is different, as it emphasizes the transformation of the house into an observatory and the wife's complaint about his job.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,B

Ref: Once there was a teacher named Mrs. Jackson who wanted a salary increase. One day, the principal said that he was increasing his own salary by 20 percent. However, he said, there was not enough money to give the teachers a salary increase.
When Mrs. Jackson heard this she became so angry that she decided to take revenge. The next day, Mrs. Jackson used gasoline to set fire to the principal's office. Then she went to a bar and got drunk.

Story B is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). In both stories, the main character (Mrs. Jackson in Ref and McGhee in Story B) becomes frustrated with a perceived unfairness (salary increase for the principal in Ref and vacation time for the captain in Story B). This frustration leads them to take extreme and destructive actions (setting fire to the principal's office in Ref and blowing up the captain's cabin in Story B). The similarities in the characters' motivations and actions make Story B the analogous story to the reference story.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

Story B is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). Both stories involve a character (Pierre in Ref and Gene in Story B) who becomes frightened and strikes a larger, more powerful creature (falcon in Ref and policeman in Story B). This action leads to a dangerous situation where both characters end up in peril and ultimately perish.

In the reference story, Pierre strikes a falcon, and they both end up high in the sky, eventually falling to their deaths at an outdoor wedding ceremony. In Story B, Gene strikes a policeman, and they both end up on the road, eventually running off the road and dying when they hit a wall.

Story A, on the other hand, does not have the same structure or elements as the reference story. In Story A, Gene panics and hits a policeman, but the policeman initiates the interaction by approaching Gene. The consequences of their actions also differ, as they die in a collision with a wall rather than falling from the sky.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

Story B is the analogous story to the reference story (Ref). Both stories involve a conflict between a young character (Pierre in Ref and Gene in Story B) and an authority figure (a falcon in Ref and a policeman in Story B). In both stories, the conflict escalates, leading to the death of both characters in a tragic accident (the falcon and Pierre in Ref, and Gene and the policeman in Story B). The key difference is the initial cause of the conflict (a snake bite in Ref and a panic attack in Story B), but the overall structure and theme of conflict and tragic consequences are similar. Story A, on the other hand, involves a different scenario with a policeman and a boy, but lacks the same level of conflict and tragic consequences as the reference story and Story B.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B
