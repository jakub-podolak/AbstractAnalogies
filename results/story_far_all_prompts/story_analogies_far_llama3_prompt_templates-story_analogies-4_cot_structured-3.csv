**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The themes of all three stories revolve around a character's dislike for a particular environment (psychiatric hospital or high school) and their desire for something they cannot have (passing the inspection or graduating). The stories also share the idea that the character's lack of motivation and procrastination leads to their failure to achieve their goal.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In all three stories, the main character is unhappy with their current situation and has a strong desire for something else. The characters in Story A and Story B are similar to William in the Source Story in that they are both unmotivated and procrastinate, leading to their failure to achieve their goal. The characters' personalities and motivations are well-developed and consistent throughout the stories.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure, with a character having a goal, facing obstacles, and ultimately failing to achieve their goal. The stories also use a similar plot device, where a promise of a reward is made to motivate the character to achieve their goal. However, the stories differ in their pacing and tone, with the Source Story having a more serious tone and Story A and Story B having a more lighthearted tone.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

After comparing the stories, I believe that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories feature a character who is unhappy with their current situation, has a strong desire for something else, and ultimately fails to achieve their goal due to their own lack of motivation. The characters' personalities and motivations are also similar in both stories.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The themes of all three stories revolve around a character's desire for something they cannot have due to their own actions or lack of effort. In the Source Story, William wants the gingerbread but fails to clean his room, while in Story A and Story B, Karen wants to go to Hawaii but fails to pass her classes. The common thread is the character's disappointment and frustration when they don't achieve their goal.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, William is a patient in a psychiatric hospital who is motivated by the promise of gingerbread. In Story A, Karen is a high school student who is motivated by the promise of a trip to Hawaii. In Story B, Karen is also a high school student who is motivated by the same promise. The character development in all three stories is similar, with the character being motivated by a promise and ultimately failing to achieve their goal. The relationships between the characters are also similar, with a caregiver (nurse or father) making a promise to the character.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure: a character is motivated by a promise, fails to achieve their goal, and ultimately suffers the consequences. The stories also share a similar tone, with a focus on the character's disappointment and frustration. However, the stories differ in terms of setting (psychiatric hospital vs. high school) and the specific details of the character's situation.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the comparisons, I believe that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. The character development, relationships, and narrative structure are all similar between the two stories. Story B is also similar, but there are some differences in the details of the character's situation and the setting.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

All three stories share a common theme: the importance of safety features in products. In the Source Story, Mr. Newton's accident leads to the development of a safety razor, while in both Story A and Story B, Ms. Boyce's accident leads to the recommendation and implementation of warning labels. The theme is similar across all three stories, highlighting the need for caution and protection in product design.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Mr. Newton is a manager who uses the new razor and is injured, leading to his consideration of the safety feature. In Story A, Ms. Boyce is also a manager who uses the new heat lamp and is injured, leading to her consideration of the warning label. The character development is similar, with both Mr. Newton and Ms. Boyce experiencing a personal incident that leads to a change in their perspective on safety features. In Story B, Ms. Boyce's character development is less direct, as she initially considers the labels unnecessary, but later changes her mind after being injured. This deviation from the Source Story's character development makes Story B less analogous.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure: introduction to the product, accident, consideration of safety feature, and implementation of safety feature. The similarities in structure suggest that the stories are drawing from a common narrative pattern. However, Story B deviates from this structure by introducing Ms. Boyce's initial reluctance to implement the warning labels, which adds a layer of complexity to the narrative.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the comparisons, I conclude that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. Story A follows the same narrative structure and character development as the Source Story, with Ms. Boyce's accident leading to her consideration of the warning label. Story B, while sharing the same theme, deviates from the Source Story's narrative structure and character development, making it less analogous.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

All three stories share a common theme: the importance of prioritizing safety and learning from personal experiences. In the Source Story, Mr. Newton learns the hard way that a new invention can be dangerous without proper safety features. Similarly, in both Story A and Story B, Ms. Boyce has a personal experience with the new heat lamps, which leads her to recognize the need for safety features.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Mr. Newton is the manager of a company that makes razors, and he is the one who uses the new razor and gets injured. In Story A, Ms. Boyce is the one who is in charge of installing sun lamps, but she is also the one who uses the new heat lamp and gets injured. In Story B, Ms. Boyce is again the one who is in charge of installing heat lamps, and she is also the one who uses the new heat lamp and gets injured. The character dynamics are similar across all three stories, with the main character being the one who experiences the accident and learns from it.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure: introduction to the new invention, accident, recognition of the need for safety features, and subsequent action to implement those features. The main difference is that the Source Story has a more detailed backstory about the invention and the company, while Story A and Story B are more concise and focused on the accident and its aftermath.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

After comparing the themes, character development, and narrative structure, I conclude that Story B is more closely related to the Source Story. Story B has a more similar character dynamic, with Ms. Boyce being the one who uses the new heat lamp and gets injured, just like Mr. Newton in the Source Story. Additionally, Story B has a more similar narrative structure, with a clear introduction to the new invention, accident, and subsequent action to implement safety features.

The theme of the Source Story is about the consequences of Joseph's pride and his attempt to solve a problem with a new solution, which ultimately leads to more problems. Story A and Story B both share similar themes of pride and the consequences of one's actions. In Story A, Alexander's pride leads him to boast about his wife's cooking, and in Story B, Alexander's pride leads him to boast about his two wives. However, the themes are not as prominent in these stories as they are in the Source Story.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Joseph is a wealthy man who hires a chauffeur to solve a problem, but his solution creates more problems. In Story A, Alexander is a man who lives with his wife and boasts about her cooking, but his solution to his hunger problem is to marry a second wife. In Story B, Alexander is a man with two wives who boasts about his culinary situation, but his solution to his hunger problem is to visit both wives, only to find that neither has prepared food for him. The relationships and character development in both stories are similar to those in the Source Story, but the characters' motivations and actions are not as nuanced.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure, which is: (1) a character boasts about their situation, (2) they encounter a problem, (3) they try to solve the problem, and (4) their solution creates more problems. However, the stories differ in their pacing and the level of detail provided. The Source Story is more concise and focused on Joseph's problem, while Story A and Story B are more detailed and have more characters.

Story A: Many years ago there was man named Alexander who had two wives living in two houses: He liked to boast to a friend that with his two wives he would always eat well.
One day when he was very hungry, Alexander went to his first wife. But she had only prepared enough for herself and their baby. She thought Alexander would eat with his other wife that day.
Alexander then went to his second wife, but found she had already finished. She saw him go to the other house so she thought he was eating there.
Thus Alexander went without any dinner at all.

Story B: Alexander was a man who lived with his wife in his house a long time ago. He liked to boast to a friend that with his wife at home he would always eat well.
One day, when he was very hungry, Alexander went home to his wife. But she thought Alexander would be eating someplace else so she had only prepared enough for herself and their baby.
Thus Alexander went without dinner. But to make sure he would not go hungry again, Alexander married a second wife.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The Source Story (Ref) is about Joseph, a millionaire who hires a chauffeur to avoid being late for conferences, but ends up being late again and decides to hire a second, more expensive chauffeur. The themes of the story are about the consequences of underestimating the importance of something (in this case, the chauffeur's role) and the potential for increased costs and complexity.

Story A and Story B both revolve around Alexander, a man who boasts about his ability to eat well with his multiple wives. The themes of these stories are about the consequences of underestimating the needs of others (in this case, the wives' ability to provide food) and the potential for disappointment and hunger.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Joseph is a wealthy and boastful character who underestimates the importance of his chauffeur. He is the main character and his actions drive the plot. In Story A, Alexander is also a boastful character who underestimates the needs of his wives. However, his character development is not as prominent as Joseph's, and the focus is more on the consequences of his actions. In Story B, Alexander is also a boastful character, but his character development is more similar to Joseph's, as he is the main character and his actions drive the plot.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories have a similar narrative structure, with a boastful character who underestimates something and faces consequences as a result. However, the Source Story has a more complex plot, with Joseph hiring a second chauffeur, whereas Story A and Story B have simpler plots with fewer twists and turns.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the comparisons, I believe that Story B is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories have a similar character development, with the main character being the boastful and underestimating individual. The narrative structure is also similar, with the character facing consequences as a result of their actions. Additionally, the themes of the stories are similar, with a focus on the consequences of underestimating the importance of something.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The Source Story (Ref) is about a hawk offering to give its feathers to a hunter to avoid being attacked. The themes are about conflict resolution, cooperation, and the value of life.

Story A and Story B both involve a country (Zerdia) and its warlike neighbor (Gagrach). The themes of both stories are about conflict resolution, but they differ in their approach. Story A is about Zerdia offering to sell its computers to Gagrach to avoid being attacked, while Story B is about Zerdia selling its computers to Gagrach, only to be surprised by a subsequent attack. The themes of both stories are similar to the Source Story in that they involve conflict resolution, but they are more focused on international relations and technology.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, the hawk (Karla) is a main character who is threatened by the hunter. The hunter is also a main character who is motivated by a desire for the hawk's feathers. The story focuses on the relationship between the two characters and how they interact with each other.

In Story A, the government of Zerdia is the main character that makes a decision to offer its computers to Gagrach. Gagrach is also a main character, but its motivations are not as well-developed as those of the hunter in the Source Story. The story focuses on the relationship between the two governments and their decision-making processes.

In Story B, the government of Zerdia is again the main character, but its decision to sell its computers to Gagrach is motivated by a desire to avoid conflict. Gagrach is also a main character, but its motivations are not as well-developed as those of the hunter in the Source Story. The story focuses on the relationship between the two governments and their decision-making processes.

Overall, the relationships and development of characters in both Story A and Story B are less nuanced and less focused on individual characters than those in the Source Story.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories have a similar narrative structure, which involves a conflict or threat, a decision or action taken by a main character, and a resolution or outcome. However, the Source Story is more focused on the individual characters and their interactions, while Story A and Story B are more focused on the international relations and technological aspects of the conflict.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the comparisons, I believe that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories involve a conflict or threat, a decision or action taken by a main character, and a resolution or outcome. The themes of both stories are also similar, focusing on conflict resolution and cooperation. The relationships and development of characters in both stories are also similar, with a focus on the main character's decision-making process.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The Source Story (Ref) is about a hawk offering its feathers to a hunter to avoid being attacked. The themes are about conflict resolution, cooperation, and the value of compromise. In both Story A and Story B, the theme of conflict resolution is present, but it's approached differently. Story A is about a country offering its technology to a neighbor to avoid being attacked, while Story B is about a country offering its technology to a neighbor after being attacked. Both stories have a similar theme of finding a peaceful solution to a conflict.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, the hawk and the hunter have a direct and personal relationship. The hawk is aware of the hunter's intentions and makes a conscious decision to offer its feathers to avoid being attacked. In Story A, the relationship between Zerdia and Gagrach is more abstract, with the government of Zerdia making a decision to offer its technology to avoid being attacked. In Story B, the relationship between Zerdia and Gagrach is also more abstract, but the attack and subsequent offer of technology is more direct. The characters in all three stories are somewhat one-dimensional, with the hawk and the hunter being the most developed.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories have a similar narrative structure, with a conflict or problem being introduced, followed by a resolution or solution. However, the pacing and tone of the stories differ. The Source Story is more concise and has a more lighthearted tone, while Story A and Story B are more detailed and have a more serious tone.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

After comparing the themes, characters, and narrative structure of the three stories, I believe that Story B is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories have a more direct and personal relationship between the two parties involved, and the conflict resolution is more straightforward. Story A has a more abstract relationship between the two parties and a more complex conflict resolution.

The Source Story is about Peter, a young man who moves to Florida and tries to fit in by getting a tan, but ends up getting burned and decides to leave. The themes are about self-consciousness, trying to fit in, and the consequences of taking risks.

Story A is about Quiggly Company, a small company that tries to enter the integrated circuit market by building a space factory, but ends up losing everything. The themes are about taking risks, being competitive, and the consequences of financial decisions.

Story B is about Quiggly Company, a small company that decides to enter the integrated circuit market, but is warned by analysts that it's too expensive and competitive. The themes are about being cautious, playing it safe, and the consequences of not taking risks.

All three stories have themes related to taking risks and the consequences of those risks, but the Source Story is more focused on personal identity and self-consciousness, while Story A and Story B are more focused on business and financial decisions.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Peter is the main character, and we see his thoughts and feelings as he tries to fit in and gets burned. The story is character-driven, and we learn about Peter's personality and motivations through his actions and dialogue.

In Story A, Quiggly Company is the main character, but it's not a person, it's a company. We don't get to see the thoughts and feelings of the company's leaders or employees, and the story is more focused on the company's financial decisions and consequences.

In Story B, Quiggly Company is again the main character, but this time we see the company's leaders and employees making decisions and reacting to warnings from analysts. The story is more character-driven than Story A, but still not as much as the Source Story.

Overall, the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B are less nuanced and character-driven than in the Source Story.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories have a clear beginning, middle, and end, and follow a linear narrative structure. However, the Source Story has a more personal and introspective tone, while Story A and Story B are more focused on business and financial decisions.

The Source Story has a clear character arc, where Peter learns a lesson about self-consciousness and taking risks. Story A and Story B have more of a plot-driven narrative, where the focus is on the company's financial decisions and consequences.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The Source Story is about Peter, a young man who moves to Florida and gets burned by the sun, leading him to realize that he doesn't fit in and decides to return to his home in Iceland. The themes of the story are about self-consciousness, the dangers of taking risks, and the importance of being true to oneself.

Story A and Story B both deal with a company, Quiggly Company, that decides to take a risk by entering a new market (space manufacturing). However, the themes of these stories are more focused on the consequences of taking risks and the importance of being cautious, rather than self-consciousness or being true to oneself.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Peter is the main character, and we see his thoughts, feelings, and actions as he navigates his new environment. The story is character-driven, and Peter's development is the central focus.

In Story A and Story B, Quiggly Company is the main entity, but there is no single character that drives the story. The company's decisions and actions are the focus, but we don't get to see the inner thoughts and feelings of the people involved. The stories are more plot-driven than character-driven.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories have a clear beginning, middle, and end, and they follow a linear narrative structure. However, the Source Story is more focused on Peter's personal journey, while Story A and Story B are more focused on the company's business decisions.

The Source Story has a more dramatic arc, with Peter's mistake leading to a dramatic consequence (second-degree burns). Story A and Story B have a more gradual build-up of tension, as the company's decisions lead to financial consequences.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

After comparing the themes, characters, and narrative structures, I believe that Story B is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories feature a character (Peter/Quiggly Company) who takes a risk and suffers the consequences. The themes of self-consciousness and the importance of being true to oneself are also present in both stories.

The Source Story is about Julius, a mule who is disappointed when he can't get the pears he wants due to their high location and his own weakness. The themes of the story are about desire, disappointment, and the limitations of one's abilities.

Story A is about Cindy, a girl who is disappointed when she can't afford the records she wants. The themes of the story are similar to the Source Story, focusing on desire, disappointment, and the limitations of one's resources.

Story B is about Cindy, a girl who is initially disappointed when she can't afford the records she wants, but then gets over her disappointment and decides that the records are probably boring anyway.

The character development in both stories is similar, as both characters are motivated by their desires and experience disappointment when they can't achieve them.

In Story B, Cindy's character development is different, as she initially experiences disappointment but then gets over it and changes her perspective on the records. This is not similar to the character development in the Source Story, where Julius's disappointment is a central part of the story.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories have a similar narrative structure, with a character experiencing desire, facing obstacles, and experiencing disappointment. However, the Source Story and Story A have a more straightforward narrative structure, with a clear build-up to the disappointment. Story B has a more complex narrative structure, with a twist in the character's perspective on the records.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the comparisons, I believe that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories have a similar theme, character development, and narrative structure. Story B has a different theme and character development, and its narrative structure is more complex.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The Source Story is about Julius, a mule who is disappointed when he can't get pears because they're too high and he's too weak. He then goes to sleep, dreaming about pears. The themes of the story are disappointment, frustration, and the power of imagination.

Story A is about Cindy, who is disappointed when she can't afford records she wants. She then rationalizes that the records might be boring anyway, so it's not a big loss. The themes of Story A are disappointment and rationalization.

Story B is about Cindy, who is curious about some records but thinks they look bad. She decides to buy them to test her hunch, but ultimately can't afford them. The themes of Story B are curiosity, skepticism, and disappointment.

All three stories deal with disappointment, but the themes and motivations of the characters are different.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Julius is a mule who is driven by his desire for pears. He's frustrated when he can't get them, and then goes to sleep, dreaming about pears. The character development is simple and focused on his desire.

In Story A, Cindy is a girl who is disappointed when she can't afford records. She then rationalizes that the records might be boring anyway. The character development is minimal, and Cindy's motivations are more focused on her wallet than her desires.

In Story B, Cindy is a girl who is curious about some records but thinks they look bad. She decides to buy them to test her hunch, but ultimately can't afford them. The character development is more nuanced, as Cindy is driven by her curiosity and skepticism.

Overall, the character development in Story B is more similar to that in the Source Story, as both characters are driven by their desires and motivations.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories have a simple narrative structure, with a clear setup, conflict, and resolution. However, the Source Story has a more whimsical and fantastical tone, while Story A and Story B are more grounded in reality.

The Source Story has a more circular structure, with Julius's disappointment leading to his imagination and then back to his disappointment. Story A and Story B have a more linear structure, with a clear beginning, middle, and end.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the comparisons, I believe that Story B is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories have similar themes and character motivations, and the narrative structure is more similar. Story B also has a more whimsical and curious tone, which is similar to the Source Story.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The Source Story is about Percy, a mockingbird, who tries to trade his singing for sunflower seeds with a squirrel, but is rejected due to his poor singing. The themes of the story are about the consequences of one's actions (Percy's singing) and the importance of being genuine and sincere.

Story A and Story B both revolve around a character (Sam) who tries to get something from someone else (his mother) by giving them a gift, but is rejected. The themes of these stories seem to be about the consequences of one's actions (Sam's wasteful spending) and the importance of being responsible and hardworking.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Percy is a main character who is trying to get something from the squirrel. The squirrel is a secondary character who is initially pleased but then disappointed with Percy's singing. The relationship between Percy and the squirrel is one of mutual expectation, with Percy expecting something in return for his singing.

In Story A, Sam is a main character who is trying to get something from his mother. His mother is a secondary character who is initially displeased with Sam's gift. The relationship between Sam and his mother is one of expectation, with Sam hoping to get a loan from his mother in return for the gift.

In Story B, Sam is also a main character who is trying to get something from his mother. However, the relationship between Sam and his mother is more complex, as Sam's mother is initially displeased with him for wasting his time, and only later reacts to the gift. This adds a layer of depth to the relationship between Sam and his mother.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure: a character tries to get something from someone else by giving them something in return, but is rejected. However, the Source Story is more focused on the consequences of Percy's actions, while Story A and Story B are more focused on the relationships between the characters.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the comparisons, I believe that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories feature a character trying to get something from someone else by giving them something in return, but being rejected due to the quality of the gift. The relationships and character development in Story A are also more similar to those in the Source Story.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The Source Story, Ref, is about a dog named Leonard who loses his dinner and then tries to take another dog's steak, but ends up losing a tooth. The themes of the story are about loss, greed, and the consequences of one's actions.

Story A, on the other hand, is about a man named Charlie who loses his expensive pocket watch and then tries to take another man's watch, but ends up getting caught by a policeman. The themes of Story A are also about loss, greed, and the consequences of one's actions, similar to the Source Story.

Story B is about a man named Charlie who mistakes his own reflection for another man and tries to take his own watch, resulting in both watches shattering on the floor. The themes of Story B are about self-deception, greed, and the consequences of one's actions, which are similar to the Source Story.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Leonard is a dog who is driven by his desire for food and ends up getting into a scuffle with another dog. In Story A, Charlie is a man who is driven by his desire for material possessions and ends up getting caught by a policeman. In both stories, the characters' desires lead to their downfall.

In Story B, Charlie is also driven by his desire for material possessions, but his self-deception and lack of self-awareness lead to his downfall. The character development in Story B is similar to the Source Story in that both stories feature a character who is driven by their desires and ends up getting into trouble.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure, which is:

* Introduction: Introduce the main character and their desire
* Inciting Incident: The character's desire leads to a problem or conflict
* Rising Action: The character tries to resolve the problem or conflict, but ends up making things worse
* Climax: The character's actions lead to a turning point or a moment of realization
* Resolution: The story concludes with the character facing the consequences of their actions

The main difference between the stories is the tone and the level of complexity. The Source Story is a simple and lighthearted tale about a dog's misadventures, while Story A is a more serious and cautionary tale about the consequences of greed. Story B is a more absurd and humorous tale about self-deception.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the comparisons, I believe that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story.

All three stories share a common theme of loss and subsequent greed. In the Source Story, Leonard loses his steak and tries to take another dog's steak, leading to further loss. In Story A, Charlie loses his watch and tries to take another man's watch, also resulting in loss. In Story B, Charlie loses his watch and tries to take another man's watch, but this time it's a policeman, which adds a new layer of complexity. The theme of loss and greed is present in all three stories, but with varying degrees of complexity.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Leonard is a dog who loses his steak and then tries to take another dog's steak. In Story A, Charlie is a human who loses his watch and tries to take another man's watch. The character dynamics are similar, but the species and objects involved are different. In Story B, Charlie is also a human who loses his watch and tries to take another man's watch, but the addition of the policeman adds a new layer of complexity to the character dynamics. Overall, the character relationships and development in all three stories are similar, but with some variations.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure: a character loses something, tries to take something else, and ends up in a worse situation. The stories have a similar cause-and-effect chain of events. However, the pacing and tone of the stories differ. The Source Story is more lighthearted and humorous, while Story A is more straightforward and serious. Story B adds a new layer of complexity with the policeman, which changes the tone and pacing of the story.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

After comparing the themes, character relationships, and narrative structures, I conclude that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories share a similar theme of loss and greed, and the character dynamics are similar. The narrative structure is also similar, with a character losing something and trying to take something else. While Story B adds a new layer of complexity with the policeman, it deviates more from the Source Story's lighthearted and humorous tone.

Story A is about a couple, John and Christine, who get married, but Christine's recklessness causes problems, which lead to a restriction on her driving privileges. The theme of Story A is also about relationships and trust, but with a focus on the consequences of reckless behavior.

Story B is also about a couple, John and Christine, who get married, but John discovers Christine's reckless driving habits, which lead to a restriction on her driving privileges. The theme of Story B is similar to the Source Story, as it also explores the consequences of someone's actions and the importance of trust in a relationship.

In Story B, John and Christine are also a couple, but their relationship is more strained due to John's discovery of Christine's reckless driving habits.

The character development in Story A is more focused on Christine's reckless behavior and its consequences, whereas in Story B, the character development is more focused on John's discovery of Christine's habits and his reaction to it. In the Source Story, the character development is more focused on Ivan's absent-mindedness and his redemption.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure, which includes an introduction to the characters and their relationship, a problem or conflict arises, and the conflict is resolved. However, the Source Story has a more gradual build-up of tension, whereas Story A and Story B have a more sudden and dramatic conflict.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the comparisons, I believe that Story B is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories feature a character who makes a mistake (Ivan in the Source Story, Christine in Story B) and then redeems themselves. The themes of trust, relationships, and redemption are also similar in both stories.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The Source Story is about two friends, Boris and Ivan, who open a store together, but Ivan's absent-mindedness causes problems. The theme is about the importance of trust and cooperation in a partnership.

Story A and Story B are both about a couple, John and Christine, who have a disagreement about Christine's reckless behavior. The theme is about the consequences of reckless behavior and the importance of compromise in a relationship.

While both stories deal with the consequences of someone's actions, the themes are slightly different. The Source Story focuses on the importance of trust and cooperation in a partnership, while Story A and Story B focus on the importance of compromise in a relationship.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Boris and Ivan are friends who start a business together. They have a disagreement about Ivan's absent-mindedness, but they are able to work through their issues and find a solution.

In Story A, John and Christine are a couple who are getting married. They have a disagreement about Christine's reckless driving, and Christine's behavior becomes increasingly destructive. The relationship between John and Christine is more intense and emotional than the relationship between Boris and Ivan.

In Story B, John and Christine are also a couple who are getting married. They have a disagreement about Christine's reckless driving, and John insists that she never drive his car again. The relationship between John and Christine is similar to the one in Story A, with a focus on the consequences of Christine's behavior.

Overall, the relationships and character development in Story B are more similar to those in the Source Story, with a focus on a disagreement between two friends or partners who are able to work through their issues.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure, with a setup, a conflict, and a resolution. However, the tone and focus of the stories are different. The Source Story is more lighthearted and humorous, while Story A and Story B are more serious and dramatic.

The Source Story has a more gradual build-up to the conflict, with Ivan's absent-mindedness causing problems over time. Story A and Story B have a more sudden and intense conflict, with Christine's reckless behavior causing immediate problems.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The themes of all three stories revolve around the concept of ""making the best of a bad situation"" and the consequences of trying to appease a powerful and aggressive entity. In the Source Story, Bolon tries to make a treaty with Mayonia to ensure its own independence, but ultimately fails. Similarly, in both Story A and Story B, the characters (Moreland) try to make the best of the situation by offering to help Chad rob Lincoln, but ultimately end up getting robbed themselves.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Bolon is the aggressor that takes over Salam, and then tries to make a treaty with Mayonia. In Story A, Moreland is the one who overpowers Lincoln, mirroring Bolon's actions. In Story B, Moreland offers to help Chad rob Lincoln, which is a more passive and cowardly act, similar to Bolon's proposal to give Mayonia control over Salam. The character development in all three stories is similar, with the main character (Moreland/Bolon) trying to navigate a difficult situation and ultimately failing.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure: a situation arises, the main character tries to make the best of it, and ultimately fails. The stories also share similar plot twists, such as the main character's attempt to appease the powerful entity backfiring. However, the stories differ in terms of the characters' motivations and actions. The Source Story is more focused on the political and military aspects of the situation, while Story A and Story B are more focused on the personal and social dynamics between the characters.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the comparisons, I believe that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. The character development and relationships in Story A are more similar to those in the Source Story, with Moreland mirroring Bolon's actions and motivations. Additionally, the plot twists and narrative structure of Story A are more similar to those in the Source Story.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The themes of all three stories revolve around the concept of exploitation and the consequences of making deals with powerful entities. In the Source Story, Bolon makes a deal with Mayonia, only to be overpowered and exploited. Similarly, in Story A and Story B, Lincoln and Moreland are exploited by Chad, who takes advantage of their fear and vulnerability. The themes of power imbalance, exploitation, and the consequences of making deals with powerful entities are common to all three stories.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Bolon is the aggressor that takes over Salam, and then makes a deal with Mayonia. In Story A, Moreland is the one who initially makes a deal with Chad, while in Story B, Moreland overpowers Lincoln and then makes a deal with Chad. The relationships and character developments in both stories are similar to those in the Source Story, with a focus on the dynamics between the two smaller entities (Bolon/Salam and Lincoln/Moreland) and the powerful entity (Mayonia/Chad).

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure, with a setup, a conflict, and a resolution. However, the pace and tone of the stories differ. The Source Story is more serious and focused on the consequences of war and exploitation, while Story A and Story B are more focused on the personal dynamics between the characters. Additionally, the Source Story has a more complex plot with multiple events, while Story A and Story B have a more straightforward narrative.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

After comparing the themes, character developments, and narrative structures, I conclude that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories feature a smaller entity (Bolon/Salam and Lincoln) that is exploited by a more powerful entity (Mayonia/Chad). The dynamics between the characters, including the initial deal-making and the subsequent exploitation, are similar in both stories.

All three stories share a theme of a valued possession (tree or canary) that is transferred to a new owner, leading to its revival. The Source Story and Story A both have a positive outcome, where the tree/canary thrives under the new owner's care. Story B, however, has a negative outcome, where the canary becomes fatally ill.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Beedle is a farmer who values his apricot tree and is willing to part with it to ensure its survival. The judge is a character who appreciates the tree and takes care of it. In Story A, Mr. Gerson is a pet owner who values his canary and is willing to part with it to ensure its survival. The veterinarian friend is a character who appreciates the canary and takes care of it. In Story B, Mr. Gerson is again a pet owner who values his canary, but the wealthy businessman is a character who takes the canary without showing much care or appreciation for it. The relationships and character development in Story A align more closely with those in the Source Story, as both stories feature a character who values the possession and a character who takes care of it.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure: introduction to the valued possession, a problem arises, the possession is transferred to a new owner, and the outcome is revealed. The main difference is that Story B has a negative outcome, while the other two stories have positive outcomes. Story A and the Source Story also both feature a character who is willing to part with the possession to ensure its survival, while Story B does not.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

The Source Story is about a farmer who values a special apricot tree and gives it away to a judge who takes care of it, resulting in the tree bearing delicious apricots again. Story A and Story B both revolve around a person (Mr. Gerson) who values a pet (a canary) and gives it away to someone else.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Beedle is a kind and generous farmer who values his apricot tree and gives it away to the judge, who takes care of it. In Story A, Mr. Gerson is also a kind and generous person who gives away his canary, but the outcome is negative. In Story B, Mr. Gerson is also kind and generous, and the outcome is positive. The judge in the Source Story is portrayed as a benevolent character who takes care of the apricot tree, while the wealthy businessman in Story A is portrayed as someone who wants the canary for personal gain. The veterinarian in Story B is portrayed as someone who genuinely cares for the canary.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

Ref: Morris was a simple-minded prisoner who loved to play the harmonica at night. Finally, his cellmate got tired of this and demanded that he shut up. He should always play during the day, the cellmate insisted.
 The next night, Morris escaped from prison and hid in a boxcar. But then Morris remembered that his cellmate said he should play harmonica every day, so he started playing. Immediately, Morris was nabbed by the cops. Poor, simple-minded Morris wished he hadn't paid any attention to his cellmate. Back in his cell, he devoted himself to covering the walls with obscenites.

Story A: A little girl named Jenny loved to play with her dog in her neighbor's yard. Eventually, the neighbor got fed-up and told her she should always play with her dog in her own yard. 
 A few days later, Jenny snuck out of the house without doing her chores and hid at the playground. But after awhile she went home to play with her dog because she thought her neighbor said she should every day. Right away her mother caught her and the little girl wished she hadn't listened to her neighbor.

5/ State the final answer. Provide final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>","Here are my answers:

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The themes of all three stories revolve around the consequences of following advice or rules. In the Source Story, Morris's cellmate tells him to play the harmonica during the day, and Morris's obedience leads to his recapture. In Story A, Jenny's neighbor tells her to play with her dog in her own yard, and Jenny's obedience leads to her getting caught by her mother. In Story B, Jenny's neighbor tells her to play in her own yard, but Jenny refuses to listen, leading to her getting caught by her mother. The common thread is that following rules or advice can lead to negative consequences.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Morris is a simple-minded prisoner who is obedient to his cellmate's demands. In Story A, Jenny is a little girl who is obedient to her neighbor's demands. In Story B, Jenny is also a little girl who is initially disobedient to her neighbor's demands. The characters in all three stories are children or individuals who are easily influenced by others. The relationships between the characters are also similar, with a authority figure (cellmate, neighbor) giving advice or rules to the protagonist, which they then follow or refuse to follow.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories have a similar narrative structure: a character is given advice or rules, they follow or refuse to follow them, and then face consequences. The stories also have a similar tone, with a focus on the consequences of obedience or disobedience. However, the stories differ in terms of the setting and the specific circumstances. The Source Story takes place in a prison, while Story A and Story B take place in a residential setting.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the comparisons, I believe that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories feature a simple-minded protagonist who is obedient to the advice of an authority figure, and both stories have a similar narrative structure. The themes and characters in Story A are also more similar to those in the Source Story than in Story B.

1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story:

All three stories share a common theme of a character being told to do something, but then doing the opposite and facing consequences. In the Source Story, Morris is told to play the harmonica during the day, but he plays it at night and gets caught. In Story A, Jenny is told to play with her dog in her own yard, but she thinks it's bad luck and plays in her neighbor's yard, getting caught. In Story B, Jenny is told to play with her dog in her own yard, but she thinks her neighbor meant she should play every day and plays with her dog at home, getting caught. The theme of disobedience and consequences is present in all three stories.

2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story:

In the Source Story, Morris is a simple-minded prisoner who is told to do something by his cellmate, but he doesn't think it through and gets caught. In Story A, Jenny is a little girl who is told to do something by her neighbor, but she doesn't think it's a good idea and does the opposite. In Story B, Jenny is also a little girl who is told to do something by her neighbor, but she misinterprets the instruction and does the opposite. The characters in all three stories are similar in that they are told to do something, but they don't think it through and face consequences. The relationships between the characters are also similar, with a authority figure (cellmate/neighbor) telling the main character what to do.

3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories:

All three stories have a similar narrative structure, with a character being told to do something, doing the opposite, and facing consequences. However, the stories differ in terms of the details and the tone. The Source Story is more humorous and lighthearted, while Story A and Story B are more serious and straightforward. The stories also differ in terms of the characters' motivations and actions. Morris in the Source Story is more reckless and impulsive, while Jenny in Story A and Story B is more mischievous and disobedient.

4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story:

Based on the comparisons, I believe that Story B is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories have a similar narrative structure, with a character being told to do something, doing the opposite, and facing consequences. The characters in both stories are also similar, with a simple-minded or mischievous main character who doesn't think things through. The tone and details of the stories are also similar, with a focus on the consequences of disobedience.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The themes of all three stories revolve around the importance of balance and the consequences of obsession. In the Source Story, King Otto's obsession with conquest and riches leads to neglect of his kingdom's infrastructure, resulting in a personal injury. In Story A, Cornelius's obsession with astronomy leads to neglect of his home, resulting in a personal injury. In Story B, Cornelius's obsession with astronomy also leads to neglect of his home, resulting in a personal injury. The common thread is that the main character's single-minded focus on one aspect of their life leads to neglect of other important aspects, resulting in negative consequences.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, King Otto is a warmonger who is advised by a chamberlain. In Story A, Cornelius is an astronomer who is advised by his wife Agatha. In Story B, Cornelius is also an astronomer who is advised by his wife Agatha. The relationships between the main characters and their advisors are similar, with the advisor serving as a voice of reason and caution. The development of the characters is also similar, with the main character initially ignoring the advice of their advisor and only changing their ways after a personal injury.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure, with the main character's obsession leading to neglect, a personal injury occurring, and the main character subsequently changing their ways. The stories also share similar plot twists, such as the main character's injury occurring due to their own neglect. However, the stories differ in terms of the specific details and settings. Story A and Story B are more focused on the personal relationships and domestic life of the main character, while the Source Story is more focused on the main character's military and political ambitions.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the comparisons, I believe that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. The themes, characters, and narrative structure of Story A are more similar to those of the Source Story than those of Story B. The only significant difference is the setting, with Story A taking place in a domestic setting and the Source Story taking place in a political setting.

The themes of all three stories revolve around the importance of balance and prioritization. In the Source Story, King Otto's obsession with conquest and riches leads to neglect of his kingdom's infrastructure, resulting in a personal injury. In Story A, Cornelius's obsession with astronomy leads to neglect of his home, resulting in a personal injury. In Story B, Cornelius's obsession with astronomy leads to neglect of his home, which becomes uninhabitable. The common thread is that the main character's single-minded focus on one aspect of their life leads to neglect of other important aspects, resulting in negative consequences.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, King Otto is a warmonger who is advised by a chamberlain. In Story A, Cornelius is an astronomer who is advised by his wife Agatha. In Story B, Cornelius is also an astronomer who is advised by his wife Agatha. The relationships between the main characters and their advisors are similar, with the advisor trying to caution the main character against their obsessive behavior. The development of the characters is also similar, as they all undergo a transformation from being single-mindedly focused on one aspect of their life to recognizing the importance of balance.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure: the main character becomes obsessed with something, neglects other important aspects of their life, and then suffers a personal injury that forces them to re-evaluate their priorities. The stories also share a similar tone, with a focus on the consequences of the main character's actions.

However, there are some differences in the narrative structure. In the Source Story, King Otto's obsession with conquest is a gradual process, while in Story A and Story B, Cornelius's obsession with astronomy is more sudden and all-consuming. Additionally, the Source Story has a more dramatic plot twist, with King Otto's carriage crashing through an unfinished bridge, while Story A and Story B have more straightforward narrative developments.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the comparisons, I believe that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. The relationships and development of characters in Story A are more similar to those in the Source Story, and the narrative structure is also more similar. Story B has some similarities, but the tone and narrative structure are slightly different.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The themes of all three stories revolve around the idea of a person trying to protect themselves from a perceived threat (lion/beggar) and learning a lesson about the consequences of their actions. In the Source Story, Frederick learns to prioritize his flock's safety over his own fear, while in both Story A and Story B, Zebediah learns to prioritize his own safety over his fear of losing money. The themes are similar, but with a focus shift from protecting a flock to protecting personal wealth.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Frederick is a shepherd who is initially scared but learns to prioritize his flock's safety. In Story A, Zebediah is an old miser who is initially frightened but learns to prioritize his own safety. In Story B, Zebediah is also an old miser who is initially dozing off but learns to prioritize his own safety. While the characters' personalities and motivations differ, their development and relationships with the perceived threats (lion/beggar) are similar. Zebediah's character development is more focused on his miserly nature, whereas Frederick's is more focused on his responsibility as a shepherd.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure: introduction, conflict, resolution, and a twist. The stories also share similar plot elements, such as the sudden appearance of a threat, the protagonist's initial fear, and the use of a distraction to escape. However, the stories differ in their pacing and tone. The Source Story has a more dramatic and intense tone, while Story A and Story B have a more comedic and lighthearted tone.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

After comparing the themes, characters, and narrative structures, I conclude that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories feature a protagonist who is initially scared, uses a distraction to escape, and learns a lesson about the consequences of their actions. The similarities in plot elements and narrative structure between the two stories are more striking than between the Source Story and Story B.

Ref: Frederick the shepherd was tending his flock at the edge of a forest. Suddenly, a lion appeared out of the forest. Frederick was really scared so he started shouting to scare the lion away. But the shouting did nothing but attract the lion's attention and it began walking towards him. He then realized he should have left it alone. 
 To escape, Frederick gave the lion a lamb. While the lion was occupied, he led the rest of the flock away. Eventually, he guessed they were far enough away to be safe from the lion. So he took a nap on the grass.
 However, when he awoke he notice another lamb was missing and he could not find it anywhere! At the next opportunity, Frederick bought a blunderbuss so he could better defend his flock in the future.

5/ State the final answer. Provide final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>","Here are my answers:

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The Source Story is about Frederick, a shepherd who uses a lamb to distract a lion and escape with his flock. The themes of the story are about using cunning and resourcefulness to overcome a threat, and the consequences of underestimating the power of a predator.

Story A and Story B both feature Zebediah, an old miser, who is threatened by a beggar. The themes of these stories are similar to the Source Story, as they also involve using cunning and resourcefulness to escape a threat. However, the tone of the stories is more comedic, and the threats are more human-made (a beggar) rather than natural (a lion).

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Frederick is a brave and resourceful shepherd who uses his wits to escape the lion. Zebediah, on the other hand, is a miserly old man who is more concerned with his money than with his safety. In both Story A and Story B, Zebediah is portrayed as a cowardly and selfish character who prioritizes his own safety over the well-being of others.

The relationships between the characters in the three stories are also similar. In the Source Story, Frederick has a responsibility to his flock, and he uses his cunning to protect them. In Story A and Story B, Zebediah has a responsibility to himself and his money, and he uses his cunning to protect it.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure, which involves a threat, a failed attempt to escape, and a successful use of cunning to escape. However, the stories differ in terms of the details and the tone. The Source Story is more serious and suspenseful, while Story A and Story B are more comedic and lighthearted.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

After comparing the themes, characters, and narrative structures of the three stories, I believe that Story B is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories feature a character who uses cunning to escape a threat, and both stories have a similar narrative structure. Story A, on the other hand, has some significant differences in terms of the tone and the character of Zebediah.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The Source Story and both Story A and Story B revolve around a character (Mark/Linda) who is suddenly attacked or pestered by the people they are supposed to care for (chickens/girl scouts). The themes of chaos, unexpected events, and the character's frustration and anger are common to all three stories.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Mark is a chicken farmer who is attacked by his own chickens. In Story A, Linda is a camp director who is pestered by her girl scouts. In Story B, Linda is also a camp director who is attacked by her girl scouts. The relationships between the characters are similar, with the director being the target of the sudden and unexpected attack. The character development is also similar, with the director being portrayed as frustrated and angry.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories have a similar narrative structure, with a sudden and unexpected event (chickens attacking Mark, girl scouts returning to Linda, tidal wave hitting the beach) followed by chaos and the character's reaction. However, the Source Story and Story A have a more linear narrative, with the event and the character's reaction happening in quick succession. Story B, on the other hand, has a more non-linear narrative, with the event happening before the character's reaction.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the similarities in themes, character relationships, and narrative structure, I believe that Story B is more closely related to the Source Story. The events in Story B are more closely mirrored in the Source Story, with the girl scouts returning to Linda and attacking her, similar to the chickens attacking Mark. The non-linear narrative structure of Story B also adds to its similarity to the Source Story.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The Source Story and Story A both revolve around a sudden and unexpected event (chickens attacking the farmer, tidal wave hitting the camp) that leads to chaos and conflict between the main character and the group they are responsible for. The theme of ungratefulness or lack of appreciation is present in both stories, as the main character is frustrated by the group's behavior. In contrast, Story B does not have a sudden and unexpected event, and the theme is more focused on the director's frustration with the scouts' constant questions.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Mark is a chicken farmer who is attacked by his own chickens, and his character is developed through his reaction to the situation. In Story A, Linda is the camp director who is attacked by the girl scouts, and her character is also developed through her reaction. The relationships between the main character and the group are similar in both stories, with the main character being frustrated by the group's behavior. In Story B, Linda is also the camp director, but the story does not develop her character as much, and the relationship between her and the scouts is more focused on their constant questions.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure, with a sudden event leading to chaos and conflict, and the main character reacting to the situation. However, the Source Story and Story A both have a more dramatic and unexpected twist (the chickens attacking, the tidal wave hitting), while Story B does not have a sudden event. Additionally, the Source Story and Story A both have a clear resolution (Mark quitting chicken farming, the camp director running away), while Story B ends abruptly with the tidal wave hitting.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the comparisons, I believe that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories have a sudden and unexpected event, and the main character is attacked by the group they are responsible for. The themes of ungratefulness and frustration are also present in both stories. While Story B has some similarities, it does not have a sudden event and the relationship between the director and the scouts is more focused on their constant questions.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

All three stories share a similar theme of conflict arising from a shared discovery, and the resolution of the conflict through a third party's intervention. In the Source Story, the theme is about two pioneers fighting over a valley and eventually becoming friends after a third party (Sheriff Jones) intervenes. In Story A, the theme is about two people arguing over a twenty-dollar bill and eventually realizing they should have divided it themselves. In Story B, the theme is about two people arguing over a twenty-dollar bill, but ultimately losing out to a third party (Lee) who takes the money. While the themes are similar, Story A's theme is more closely aligned with the Source Story's theme of conflict resolution through a third party's intervention.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, the two pioneers, Smith and Johnson, are initially adversaries but eventually become friends after the third party's intervention. In Story A, Betty and Norma are also initially adversaries but eventually realize they should have divided the money themselves. This character development is similar to the Source Story. In Story B, the characters' relationships and development are not as well-aligned with the Source Story, as they do not become friends or learn a lesson from their conflict.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure: a shared discovery leads to conflict, which is eventually resolved through a third party's intervention. However, the Source Story has a more complex narrative structure, with a longer setup and a more satisfying resolution. Story A and Story B have simpler narrative structures, with a more straightforward conflict-resolution arc.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, the two pioneers, Smith and Johnson, are initially adversaries but eventually become friends. In Story B, Betty and Norma also start as adversaries but ultimately learn to cooperate and appreciate each other's company. In Story A, the characters' relationships do not develop in the same way, as they do not become friends after the conflict is resolved. The character development in Story B is more similar to that in the Source Story, as both stories feature a transformation from conflict to cooperation.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure, with a setup, conflict, and resolution. However, the Source Story has a more complex resolution, as the division of the land is a more significant event than the division of a twenty-dollar bill. Story A has a more abrupt resolution, with the money being taken by Lee without any further development. Story B has a more satisfying resolution, with the teacher's intervention leading to a positive outcome for Betty and Norma.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

The Source Story (Ref) is about a teacher, Mrs. Jackson, who seeks revenge against her principal after he increases his own salary but denies her a raise. The themes are about injustice, anger, and revenge.

Story A and Story B both involve a sailor, McGhee, who seeks revenge against his captain. However, the motivations and circumstances are different. In Story A, McGhee is upset because the captain is taking a vacation while everyone else remains on the ship. In Story B, McGhee tries to blow up the captain's cabin out of impatience, and the captain then announces a vacation to repair the ship.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Mrs. Jackson is a teacher who has a professional relationship with the principal. The principal's decision to increase his own salary while denying her a raise creates tension and leads to her revenge.

In Story A, McGhee is a sailor who has a professional relationship with the captain. The captain's decision to take a vacation while leaving everyone else on the ship creates tension and leads to McGhee's revenge.

In Story B, McGhee's motivations are unclear, and the captain's decision to take a vacation is a response to the damage caused by McGhee's actions. The relationships and character development are not as well-aligned with the Source Story.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure: a character seeks revenge against someone who has wronged them. However, the Source Story has a more gradual build-up of tension, with Mrs. Jackson's anger growing over time. Story A and Story B have more sudden and direct actions, with McGhee's revenge occurring shortly after the captain's decision.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the comparisons, I believe that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories involve a character seeking revenge against someone who has wronged them, and the motivations and circumstances are similar. The relationships and character development are also more aligned in Story A.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The Source Story is about a teacher, Mrs. Jackson, who seeks revenge against her principal after he increases his own salary but not hers. The themes of the story are about the consequences of seeking revenge and the unfairness of unequal treatment.

Story A and Story B both involve a sailor, McGhee, who seeks revenge against his captain after being denied a vacation. The themes of these stories are also about seeking revenge and the consequences of doing so. However, the tone of the stories is more focused on the sailor's frustration and anger rather than the unfairness of the situation.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Mrs. Jackson is a teacher who is motivated by a desire for a salary increase. She becomes angry and seeks revenge against the principal. In Story A, McGhee is a sailor who is motivated by a desire for a vacation. He becomes impatient and seeks revenge against the captain. In Story B, McGhee is also a sailor who is motivated by a desire for a vacation, but he becomes upset and seeks revenge against the captain.

The relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B are similar to those in the Source Story in that they all involve a character seeking revenge against someone who has wronged them. However, the motivations and emotions of the characters are slightly different.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure, which involves a character seeking revenge against someone who has wronged them. The stories also all have a similar plot twist, in which the character's revenge is revealed.

However, the stories differ in terms of the details of the plot. In the Source Story, Mrs. Jackson sets fire to the principal's office, while in Story A, McGhee tries to blow up the captain's cabin. In Story B, McGhee actually blows up the captain's cabin.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

Based on the comparisons, I believe that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. Both stories involve a character seeking revenge against someone who has wronged them, and both stories have a similar narrative structure. The only significant difference between the two stories is the method of revenge, which is set fire to the principal's office in the Source Story and dynamite in Story A.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The Source Story and both Story A and Story B revolve around a similar theme of a character's reckless behavior leading to a tragic outcome. In the Source Story, Pierre's fear and panic cause him to strike the falcon, leading to their downfall. Similarly, in both Story A and Story B, Gene's panic and hitting the policeman result in their deaths. The theme of reckless behavior and its consequences is present in all three stories.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Pierre is a cobra who is frightened by the falcon and strikes out in self-defense. In Story A, Gene is a young boy who panics and hits the policeman. In Story B, Gene is also a young boy who is grabbed by the policeman, but then panics and hits the policeman. The character dynamics are similar in all three stories, with a protagonist who acts impulsively and causes harm to another character.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure, with a setup, a conflict, and a tragic outcome. However, the Source Story has a more gradual build-up of tension, with the falcon's approach and Pierre's fear leading to the conflict. In both Story A and Story B, the conflict is more sudden, with Gene's panic and hitting the policeman occurring quickly after the policeman's approach. Additionally, the Source Story has a more unexpected twist with the falcon's weakness and the subsequent crash, whereas the outcomes in Story A and Story B are more predictable.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

After analyzing the themes, character development, and narrative structure, I conclude that Story A is more closely related to the Source Story. While both stories have similar character dynamics and themes, Story A's narrative structure is more similar to the Source Story's gradual build-up of tension and unexpected twist. Story B's sudden conflict and more predictable outcome make it less analogous to the Source Story.

**1. Briefly summarize and compare the themes of Story A and Story B with the Source Story.**

The Source Story and both Story A and Story B revolve around a conflict between a protagonist (Pierre/Gene) and a authority figure (falcon/policeman) that ultimately leads to their downfall. The themes of fear, panic, and the consequences of one's actions are present in all three stories.

**2. Evaluate how the relationships and development of characters in Story A and Story B align with those in the Source Story.**

In the Source Story, Pierre is a cobra that strikes out of fear, while the falcon is a predator that seeks to teach Pierre a lesson. In Story A, Gene is a young boy who panics and hits the policeman, while in Story B, Gene also panics and hits the policeman. The relationships and character development in both stories are similar to those in the Source Story, with the protagonist's fear and panic leading to their downfall.

**3. Discuss the similarities and differences in the narrative structure between the stories.**

All three stories follow a similar narrative structure: a conflict arises, the protagonist's actions lead to their downfall, and the story concludes with a tragic outcome. The main difference is that the Source Story has a more elaborate setup, with the falcon's lesson and the subsequent fall from the sky, while Story A and Story B are more straightforward in their narrative.

**4. Based on the comparisons, determine which story (A or B) is more closely related to the Source Story.**

After comparing the themes, character development, and narrative structure, I conclude that Story B is more closely related to the Source Story. Story B's narrative is more similar to the Source Story, with the policeman's actions mirroring those of the falcon in the Source Story. Additionally, the character development in Story B is more in line with the Source Story, with Gene's panic and actions leading to his downfall.
