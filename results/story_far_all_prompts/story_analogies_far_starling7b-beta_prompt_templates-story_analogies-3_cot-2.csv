Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories to identify the key elements:

Source Story:
1. William is a patient in a psychiatric hospital.
2. He is confined indoors and dislikes room inspections.
3. He daydreams about food.
4. The nurse promises him gingerbread if he cleans his room.
5. He fails to clean his room in time and doesn't get the gingerbread.

Story A:
1. Karen despises high school.
2. She loves vacations and dreams about going to Hawaii.
3. Her father promises her a trip to Hawaii if she graduates.
4. She fails to graduate and doesn't go to Hawaii.

Story B:
1. Karen dislikes high school.
2. She dreams about going to Hawaii.
3. Her father promises her a trip to Hawaii if she passes enough classes.
4. She fails to pass enough classes and doesn't go to Hawaii.

Now, let's compare the stories:

Story A and the source story both involve a character who dislikes their current situation (high school for Karen, psychiatric hospital for William), has a strong desire for something else (vacation for Karen, food for William), and receives a promise from an authority figure (Karen's father, the nurse) that is contingent on their performance (graduating, cleaning the room). In both stories, the characters fail to meet the required performance and don't receive the promised reward.

Story B, on the other hand, shares some elements with the source story (dislike for school, dreaming about Hawaii, promise from an authority figure), but the outcome is different (Karen passes her classes and goes to Hawaii).

Based on these comparisons, the more analogous story to the source story is:

<ans> A </ans>

Story A shares more similarities with the source story in terms of the characters' motivations, the promises they receive, and the outcomes of their actions.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,A

Now, let's compare the stories:

Story A and Story B both have similarities with the source story in terms of the characters' struggles, the external motivation (a reward), and the ultimate failure to achieve the goal due to lack of effort. However, Story A has a stronger connection to the source story because it involves a character who dislikes their current situation (high school) and is motivated by an external promise (a trip to Hawaii) to change their behavior (passing grades).

In contrast, Story B focuses more on the character's love for vacations and the promise of a trip to Hawaii, which is not directly related to the source story's theme of confinement and the desire for freedom.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
<ans> A </ans>

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's compare the source story with Story A and Story B.

Source Story:
1. Mr. Newton manages a razor company.
2. An inventor perfects a metal that stays sharper than previous razors.
3. Mr. Newton cuts his neck severely with a new razor.
4. The inventor recommends a safety feature to prevent injuries.
5. Mr. Newton considers the safety feature necessary and starts producing safety razors.

3. Ms. Boyce is seriously burned while using a new heat lamp.
4. The supplier recommends a warning label to protect people from hurting themselves.
5. Ms. Boyce considers the labels necessary and has them printed immediately.

Story B:

3. The supplier recommends a warning label to protect people from hurting themselves.
4. Ms. Boyce initially considers the labels unnecessary.
5. Later, she is seriously burned while using a new heat lamp and has the warning labels printed immediately.

Comparing the stories, we can see that Story A is more analogous to the source story. Both involve a person in charge of installing a product (razor in the source story, heat lamps in Story A) who experiences an accident due to the improved product (sharp razor, intense heat lamp), leading to the recommendation of a safety feature or warning label. In both stories, the person in charge considers the safety feature or warning label necessary after the accident and takes immediate action to implement it.

In contrast, Story B differs in that the character initially considers the warning labels unnecessary and only changes her mind after the accident, which is not as closely aligned with the source story.

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's compare the source story with Story A and Story B.

In the source story, Mr. Newton's company perfected a new metal that made razors sharper, but it also caused him to cut his neck severely. This incident led to the recommendation of a safety feature, which Mr. Newton then implemented.

In Story A, Ms. Boyce's company perfected a new filament for sun lamps that produced more intense heat. However, unlike Mr. Newton, she initially dismissed the recommendation for a warning label, leading to her getting seriously burned. After this incident, she agreed that the labels were necessary and had them printed.

In Story B, the sequence of events is similar to Story A, but with one key difference: the supplier recommends the warning label after Ms. Boyce gets burned, not before.

Now, let's determine which story is more analogous to the source story.

Both the source story and Story A involve a new innovation (sharp metal for razors, intense heat filament for sun lamps) causing an accident that leads to the recommendation of a safety feature (safety razor, warning label). In both cases, the protagonist initially dismisses the recommendation but later agrees to implement it after experiencing the negative consequences firsthand.

Story B, on the other hand, has the supplier recommending the warning label after the accident, which is not as analogous to the source story where the inventor recommended the safety feature after the incident.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> A </ans>

Story A is more analogous to the source story because it follows a similar sequence of events and has the protagonist change their mind about the safety feature after experiencing an accident caused by the new innovation.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,B

1. Joseph is a millionaire who hires a chauffeur for his Rolls-Royce.
2. He brags about never being late for conferences due to the chauffeur.
3. One morning, the chauffeur is asleep, and Joseph is late for his conference.
4. To prevent this from happening again, Joseph hires a second chauffeur, which is expensive.

Now, let's analyze the comparison stories:

2. One day, he's hungry, but his wife only prepared food for herself and their baby.
3. Alexander goes without dinner.
4. To avoid this in the future, Alexander marries a second wife.

- He brags about never being late for conferences due to the chauffeur.
- One morning, the chauffeur is asleep, and Joseph is late for his conference.
- Joseph hires a second chauffeur to prevent this from happening again, but it's expensive.

Story A:
- Alexander has two wives and boasts about always having enough food.
- One day, he's hungry and goes to his first wife, but she only prepared for herself and their baby.
- He goes to his second wife, but she thinks he's eating at the other house.
- Alexander goes without dinner.

Story B:
- Alexander lives with his wife and boasts about always having enough food.
- One day, he's hungry and goes home, but his wife thinks he's eating elsewhere.
- Alexander goes without dinner.
- To prevent this from happening again, he marries a second wife.

Now, let's compare the stories to the source story:

Story A:
- Both involve characters who boast about something (Joseph about his chauffeur, Alexander about his wives and food).
- Both characters face a situation where their boastful claim fails (Joseph's chauffeur sleeps in, Alexander's wife doesn't prepare enough food).
- Both characters try to solve the problem by adding another person (Joseph hires a second chauffeur, Alexander marries a second wife).

Story B:
- Both involve characters who boast about something (Joseph about his chauffeur, Alexander about his wife and food).
- Both characters face a situation where their boastful claim fails (Joseph's chauffeur sleeps in, Alexander's wife thinks he's eating elsewhere).
- However, Story B does not have a clear parallel to Joseph hiring a second chauffeur to solve the problem.

Based on the analysis, Story A is more analogous to the source story because it shares more similarities in terms of the characters' boastful claims, the situations they face, and the attempts to solve the problem. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Karla, an old hawk, lived at the top of a tall oak tree. One afternoon, she saw a hunter on the ground with a bow and some crude arrows that had no feathers. The hunter took aim and shot at the hawk but missed. Karla knew the hunter wanted her feathers so she glided down to the hunter and offered to give him a few. The hunter was so grateful that he pledged never to shoot at a hawk again. He went off and shot deer instead.

# Answer:
Final answer should be in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories to identify their key elements:

Source Story:
1. Karla, an old hawk, lives at the top of a tall oak tree.
2. A hunter tries to shoot Karla but misses.
3. Karla offers her feathers to the hunter, who then pledges not to shoot at hawks again.

Story A:
1. Zerdia, a small country, creates the world's smartest computer.
2. Zerdia is attacked by its neighbor, Gagrach, but the attack fails.
3. Zerdia offers to sell its computers to Gagrach, who then promises not to attack Zerdia again.

Story B:
1. Zerdia, a small country, creates the world's smartest computer.
2. Zerdia sells a supercomputer to Gagrach to prevent an attack.
3. Later, Zerdia is attacked by Gagrach, which uses Zerdian supercomputers to guide its missiles.

Now, let's compare the source story to the two comparison stories:

Story A is more analogous to the source story because both involve a conflict (hunter vs. hawk, Gagrach vs. Zerdia) where the antagonist fails to achieve their goal (missing the shot, failing the attack). In both stories, the protagonist (Karla, Zerdia) offers something valuable (feathers, computers) to the antagonist, which leads to a change in the antagonist's behavior (hunter pledges not to shoot hawks, Gagrach promises not to attack Zerdia).

Story B, while having some similarities (conflict, offering something valuable), deviates from the source story in the outcome of the conflict (Zerdia is overwhelmed by a surprise attack) and the role of the offered item (supercomputers used against Zerdia).

Therefore, the correct answer is:
<ans> A </ans> Story A is more analogous to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,A

Source Story:
- Karla, an old hawk, lives at the top of a tall oak tree.
- A hunter tries to shoot Karla but misses.
- Karla offers the hunter her feathers, and he pledges not to shoot at hawks again.

Story A:
- Zerdia, a small country, creates the world's smartest computer.
- Zerdia sells a supercomputer to its neighbor, Gagrach, to prevent an attack.
- Gagrach attacks Zerdia using Zerdian supercomputers, which leads to Zerdia's defeat.

Story B:
- Zerdia, a small country, creates the world's smartest computer.
- Gagrach attacks Zerdia, but the missiles are poorly aimed and fail.
- Zerdia offers to sell its computers to Gagrach, and Gagrach promises not to attack Zerdia again.

Now, let's compare the source story to the two comparison stories:

Story A: In this story, Zerdia sells its supercomputer to Gagrach to prevent an attack, similar to how Karla offers her feathers to the hunter in the source story. However, the outcome is different, with Gagrach using the supercomputer to attack Zerdia.

Story B: In this story, Zerdia offers to sell its computers to Gagrach after a failed attack, which is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, a conflict is resolved through an offering, and the antagonist promises not to attack again.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

<ans> B </ans>

Story B is more analogous to the source story because it shares the key elements of conflict resolution through an offering and a promise not to attack again.<|end_of_turn|>",,B,B

2. He is self-conscious about his fair skin and wants to tan.
3. He spends a day in the sun, not understanding the dangers of sun exposure.
4. He ends up with second-degree burns and goes to the hospital.
5. He decides Florida is not for him and returns to Iceland.

Story A:

2. They enter the integrated circuit market.
3. They believe they need sophisticated space factories to compete.
4. They invest heavily in space manufacturing, not realizing the financial risk.
5. They suffer financial losses and decide to leave the integrated circuit market.

Story B:
1. Quiggly Company is a small company that manufactures conventional electrical components.
2. They start producing integrated circuits.
3. They are warned about the high costs and competitive nature of space manufacturing.
4. They decide to ignore the warning and focus on conventional electrical components.

Now, let's compare the source story to the two comparison stories:

Story A is more analogous to the source story because both involve a character (Peter in the source story and Quiggly Company in Story A) who takes a risk without fully understanding the consequences. In both cases, the character suffers negative consequences (Peter's burns and Quiggly Company's financial losses) as a result of their actions.

Story B, on the other hand, is less analogous to the source story because it focuses on a company that heeds a warning and avoids taking a risk, rather than taking a risk without understanding the consequences.

- Both stories involve a company (Peter and Quiggly Company) making a decision based on a desire to fit in or keep up with others (tanning and entering the space manufacturing market).
- Both stories result in negative consequences (second-degree burns and financial difficulties).
- Both stories end with the protagonist deciding to change their approach (returning to Iceland and returning to making conventional electrical components).

Story B:

- Both stories result in negative consequences (second-degree burns and financial difficulties).
- Both stories end with the protagonist deciding to change their approach (returning to Iceland and returning to making conventional electrical components).

Based on the analysis, both Story A and Story B share similarities with the source story in terms of the protagonist's decision, the consequences, and the resolution. However, Story B is more analogous to the source story as it involves a company entering a new market (space manufacturing) and facing financial difficulties due to underestimating the risks, which is a closer parallel to Peter's experience with sun exposure and the resulting medical costs.

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories.

Source Story:
- Percy the mockingbird sings for the squirrel expecting sunflower seeds in return.
- The squirrel is disappointed in Percy's singing and refuses to give him seeds.
- Percy is sad and vows to give up singing.

Story A:
- Sam travels the world buying things and runs out of money.
- He visits his mother, hoping she will give him a loan in return for a gift from Tibet.
- His mother is not pleased and refuses to give him money.

Story B:
- Same as Story A, but with the addition of the mother calling the gift ""a piece of junk.""

Now, let's compare the stories to the source story.

In both Story A and Story B, there is a character (Sam or Percy) who performs an action (singing or buying gifts) in hopes of receiving something in return (sunflower seeds or a loan). In both cases, the recipient is disappointed and refuses to give the character what they want.

Story A is more analogous to the source story because it follows the same structure and has similar themes of disappointment and unmet expectations. Story B adds an additional detail about the gift being ""a piece of junk,"" which is not present in the source story.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
<ans> A </ans><|end_of_turn|>",,A,B

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories.

Source Story:
1. Leonard has a steak but drops it into the lake.
2. Leonard sees another dog with a steak and tries to take it, but loses a tooth in the process.

Story A:
1. Charlie drops an expensive pocket watch and it shatters.
2. Charlie sees another man with an expensive watch and tries to take it, but is stopped by a policeman.

Story B:
1. Charlie sees another man with an expensive watch.
2. Charlie, thinking it's his own reflection, reaches out to take the watch, but drops his own watch and both shatter.

Now, let's compare the stories to the source story:

Story A: In this story, Charlie loses his own watch and tries to take another one, but is stopped by a policeman. This story has some similarities with the source story, such as the loss of an item (steak vs. watch) and the attempt to take another item. However, the outcome is different (losing a tooth vs. being stopped by a policeman).

Story B: In this story, Charlie mistakenly believes he's taking his own watch from his reflection and ends up dropping and shattering both watches. This story has some similarities with the source story, such as the loss of an item (steak vs. watch) and the attempt to take another item. However, the outcome is different (both watches shatter vs. losing a tooth).

Based on the analysis, Story A is more analogous to the source story because both involve the loss of an item and an attempt to take another item, even though the outcomes are different. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> A </ans><|end_of_turn|>",,A,A

2. Charlie sees another man with an expensive watch and tries to take it, but ends up with no watch at all.

Now, let's compare the stories to the source story.

Story A:
1. Both characters lose their valuable item (steak vs. pocket watch) due to their own actions (dropping it).
2. Both characters try to take another person's valuable item (another dog's steak vs. another man's pocket watch) and end up worse off (losing a tooth vs. losing the watch).

Story B:

2. Both characters try to take another person's valuable item (another dog's steak vs. another man's pocket watch) and end up worse off (losing a tooth vs. losing the watch).

Based on the comparison, both Story A and Story B have similarities with the source story in terms of the characters losing their valuable item due to their own actions and then trying to take another person's valuable item, only to end up worse off.

However, Story A has an additional element of greed that is present in the source story (Leonard's greed for the other dog's steak), which is not present in Story B.

# Source Story:
A farmer named Beedle had a choice apricot tree that he valued above all the rest in his garden. Every year Beedle gave presents of fruit from this tree to everyone he knew.
 But one year the tree began to wither and there was no moreof the wonderful fruit. Everyone was very unhappy.
 The judge had enjoyed the apricots from the tree very much -so much so that he resolved to take the tree to his own garden to take care of it. He paid Beedle very well and had the tree moved to his own grounds. Fortunately, as soon as it was transplanted, the tree bore delicious apricots again. That very year, the fruit won first prize in the county fair.

# Story A:
Mr. Gerson had several pets but he valued the canary above all the rest. Occasionally, he invited friends over to hear the canary sing. 
 However, one autumn the canary became very ill and there were no more of its beautiful songs. Everyone was extremely disappointed. 
 A veterinarian friend had liked the canary's songs so much that he decided he would buy the canary and put it in his office where he could look after it. He paid Mr. Gerson very well. Upon being moved, the canary sang beautiful songs again.

# Story B:
Mr. Gerson had several pets but he valued the canary above all the rest. Occasionally, he invited friends over to hear the canary sing.
 A wealthy businessman liked the canary's songs so much that one autumn he decided he wanted the bird in his house in the city where he could enjoy it every day. He paid Mr. Gerson very well and had the canary moved to his house.
 However, upon being moved the canary became fatally ill and there were no more of its beautiful songs. Everyone was extremely disappointed.

# Answer:
Final answer should be in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's identify the key elements in the source story:

1. A farmer named Beedle has a choice apricot tree that he values highly.
2. He gives fruit from this tree as presents to everyone he knows.
3. The tree begins to wither and stops producing fruit.
4. The judge, who enjoyed the apricots, decides to take the tree to his own garden and pays Beedle for it.
5. After being transplanted, the tree produces delicious apricots again and wins first prize in the county fair.

Now, let's analyze Story A:

1. Mr. Gerson has several pets, but he values the canary above all the rest.
2. He invites friends over to hear the canary sing.
3. The canary becomes ill and stops singing.
4. A veterinarian friend, who liked the canary's songs, buys the canary and takes care of it.
5. Upon being moved, the canary sings beautiful songs again.

Story A has several similarities with the source story:

- Both involve a person who values a particular item (tree vs. canary) above all others.
- Both items stop producing their special quality (fruit vs. songs) due to illness.
- Both are taken care of by someone who appreciates their value, and after being moved, they regain their special quality.

Now, let's analyze Story B:

1. Mr. Gerson has several pets, but he values the canary above all the rest.
2. He invites friends over to hear the canary sing.
3. A wealthy businessman likes the canary's songs and decides to take it to his city house.
4. Upon being moved, the canary becomes fatally ill and stops singing.
5. Everyone is extremely disappointed.

Story B has some similarities with the source story:

- Both involve a person who values a particular item (tree vs. canary) above all others.
- Both items stop producing their special quality (fruit vs. songs) due to being moved.

However, the outcome in Story B is negative (the canary becomes fatally ill), while in the source story and Story A, the outcomes are positive (the tree produces fruit again, and the canary sings beautiful songs again).

Based on these analyses, Story A is more analogous to the source story because it shares more similarities in terms of the plot progression and the positive outcomes. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Comparing the source story and the two comparison stories, we can see that Story A is more analogous to the source story. In both stories, a valued object (the apricot tree in the source story and the canary in Story A) begins to wither or become ill, causing disappointment. However, in the source story, the object is saved and thrives in a new location, while in Story A, the object dies after being moved. Story B, on the other hand, has a different outcome where the object recovers after being moved to a new location, which is not consistent with the source story.

Story A is about a little girl who disobeys her neighbor's advice and gets caught by her mother. While there is a similarity in the sense that both the source story and Story A involve characters ignoring advice and facing consequences, the source story is about a prisoner escaping from prison and getting caught due to his cellmate's advice, which is a more serious and dramatic situation.

Story B, on the other hand, involves a little girl who disobeys her neighbor's advice and gets caught by her mother, similar to Story A. However, the consequences are more severe in the source story, as the prisoner gets caught by the police and sent back to prison.

# Source Story:
Frederick the shepherd was tending his flock at the edge of a forest. Suddenly, a lion appeared out of the forest. Frederick was really scared so he started shouting to scare the lion away. But the shouting did nothing but attract the lion's attention and it began walking towards him. He then realized he should have left it alone. 
 To escape, Frederick gave the lion a lamb. While the lion was occupied, he led the rest of the flock away. Eventually, he guessed they were far enough away to be safe from the lion. So he took a nap on the grass.
 However, when he awoke he notice another lamb was missing and he could not find it anywhere! At the next opportunity, Frederick bought a blunderbuss so he could better defend his flock in the future.

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories to identify the key elements and the overall structure of each story.

Source Story:
1. Frederick is a shepherd tending his flock near a forest.
2. A lion appears and Frederick is scared.
3. Frederick tries to scare the lion away but fails and gives it a lamb to escape.
4. Frederick realizes another lamb is missing and buys a blunderbuss for future protection.

Story A:
1. Zebediah is an old miser counting his money on his porch.
2. A beggar appears and Zebediah is frightened.
3. Zebediah throws a bag of coins at the beggar to escape and hides the rest of his money.
4. Zebediah wakes up to find another bag of coins missing.

Story B:
1. Zebediah is an old miser counting his money on his porch and dozes off.
2. He wakes up to find a bag of coins missing and assumes a thief is nearby.
3. A beggar appears and Zebediah is frightened.
4. Zebediah throws a second bag of coins at the beggar to escape and hides the rest of his money.

Now, let's compare the source story to the two comparison stories:

Story A is more analogous to the source story because both stories involve a protagonist (Frederick and Zebediah) who faces a threat (a lion and a beggar, respectively) and tries to escape by giving away something valuable (a lamb and a bag of coins, respectively). In both stories, the protagonist later discovers that something else valuable is missing (a missing lamb in the source story and another missing bag of coins in Story A).

Story B, on the other hand, has a different structure and sequence of events. The missing bag of coins is mentioned at the beginning, and the beggar's appearance is a reaction to Zebediah's discovery, rather than a direct threat like in the source story.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
<ans> A </ans> Story A is more analogous to the source story.<|end_of_turn|>",,A,A

2. A lion appears and Frederick tries to scare it away, but fails.
3. Frederick gives the lion a lamb to escape and leads the rest of the flock away.
4. Frederick takes a nap and discovers a second lamb is missing.
5. Frederick buys a blunderbuss to protect his flock in the future.

4. Zebediah throws a bag of coins to the beggar to escape.
5. He takes the remaining money into the house and locks the door.
6. Zebediah wakes up again to find another bag of coins missing.

Now, let's compare the source story to the two comparison stories:

Story A is more analogous to the source story because both involve a protagonist (Frederick and Zebediah) who faces a threat (lion and beggar) and uses a strategy (giving a lamb and throwing coins) to escape. In both stories, the protagonist later discovers that another member of their group is missing (lamb and another bag of coins).

Story B, while it shares some elements with the source story (e.g., the protagonist Zebediah and the presence of a beggar), does not have the same structure or progression of events as the source story. In Story B, the protagonist does not face a direct threat from the beggar, and the missing bag of coins is not connected to the initial encounter with the beggar.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

2. The chickens return and attack Mark, who escapes into the woods.
3. A thief steals the unguarded eggs while Mark is away.

2. Linda returns and finds the damage.
3. The girl scouts return from hiking and pester Linda about the situation.

Now, let's compare the stories to the source story:

Story A:
- There is a similarity in the sense that Linda, like Mark, is dealing with an unexpected situation (the tidal wave) while others (the girl scouts) return and cause additional stress.
- However, the source story involves a thief stealing eggs, which is not present in Story A.

Story B:
- This story has a direct parallel to the source story in that both involve an unexpected event (tidal wave in Story B, chickens attacking in the source story) while the protagonist is dealing with another issue (girl scouts pestering Linda, chickens attacking Mark).
- The thief stealing eggs is not present in Story B, but the overall structure and character interactions are more similar to the source story.

Based on this analysis, the more analogous story to the source story is Story B.

Final answer should be in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans>

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories.

Source Story:
- Teacher named Mrs. Jackson wants a salary increase.
- Principal increases his own salary but not the teachers'.
- Mrs. Jackson gets angry and sets fire to the principal's office and gets drunk.

Story A:
- Sailor named McGhee wants vacation time.
- Captain takes vacation but others must stay on ship.
- McGhee gets upset and blows up the captain's cabin with dynamite.

Story B:
- Sailor named McGhee wants vacation time.
- McGhee tries to blow up the captain's cabin with dynamite.
- Captain takes vacation but others must stay on ship to repair it.

Now, let's compare the source story to the two comparison stories.

In the source story, the main character (Mrs. Jackson) is a teacher who wants a salary increase and gets angry when the principal increases his own salary but not the teachers'. She then takes revenge by setting fire to the principal's office.

In Story A, the main character (McGhee) is a sailor who wants vacation time and gets upset when the captain takes vacation but others must stay on the ship. He then takes revenge by blowing up the captain's cabin with dynamite.

In Story B, the main character (McGhee) is a sailor who wants vacation time and tries to blow up the captain's cabin with dynamite. After this incident, the captain takes vacation but others must stay on the ship to repair it.

Based on the analysis, Story A is more analogous to the source story because both involve a character who wants something (salary increase in the source story, vacation time in Story A) and gets angry when they don't receive it, leading to an act of revenge. In both stories, the act of revenge involves setting fire or causing destruction.

Therefore, the correct answer is: <ans> A </ans><|end_of_turn|>",,A,A

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories.

Source Story:
- Teacher named Mrs. Jackson wants a salary increase.
- Principal increases his own salary but not the teachers'.
- Mrs. Jackson gets angry and sets fire to the principal's office.

Story A:
- Sailor named McGhee wants vacation time.
- Captain announces vacation but requires crew to stay on board.
- McGhee gets impatient and tries to blow up the captain's cabin.

Story B:
- Sailor named McGhee wants vacation time.
- Captain announces vacation but requires crew to stay on board.
- McGhee gets upset and blows up the captain's cabin.

Now, let's compare the source story to the two comparison stories.

In both Story A and Story B, the main character (McGhee) wants something (vacation time) and reacts negatively when denied (by trying to blow up the captain's cabin). This is similar to the source story, where Mrs. Jackson wants a salary increase and reacts negatively when denied (by setting fire to the principal's office).

However, there is a key difference between the two comparison stories. In Story A, the captain announces his vacation but requires the crew to stay on board, which is not mentioned in the source story. In Story B, the captain's announcement and the crew's requirement are the same as in the source story, where the principal says there's not enough money for a salary increase.

Based on this analysis, Story B is more analogous to the source story because it shares the same key elements: the main character's desire, the negative reaction to denial, and the similarity in the situation (principal not increasing teachers' salaries vs. captain requiring crew to stay on board).

Let's think step by step.
","First, let's analyze the source story and the two comparison stories to identify their key elements:

Source Story:
1. Pierre (cobra) and the falcon interact.
2. Pierre wounds the falcon.
3. Falcon teaches Pierre a lesson by flying away with him.
4. Both Pierre and the falcon fall to their death during their flight.
5. They land in the middle of an outdoor wedding ceremony.

Story A:
1. Gene (boy) and a policeman interact.
2. Gene panics and hits the policeman.
3. Policeman wants to teach Gene a lesson and drives away with him.
4. Policeman becomes too dizzy to drive, leading to their death.

Story B:
1. Gene (boy) and a policeman interact.
2. Policeman grabs Gene and drives away with him.
3. Gene panics and hits the policeman.
4. Policeman becomes too dizzy to drive, leading to their death.

Now, let's compare the key elements of the source story with those of the comparison stories:

- Both Story A and Story B have elements of conflict and consequences, similar to the source story.
- However, Story A has a different sequence of events compared to the source story. In Story A, Gene initiates the conflict by hitting the policeman, while in the source story, Pierre initiates the conflict by wounding the falcon.
- Story B has a similar sequence of events to the source story, with the conflict initiated by the falcon (policeman) and consequences leading to the death of both characters.

Based on this analysis, Story B is more analogous to the source story as it shares a similar sequence of events and conflict initiation. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<ans> B </ans><|end_of_turn|>",,B,A

2. Gene hits the policeman, causing him to become dizzy.
3. Policeman grabs Gene to teach him a lesson.
4. Both Gene and the policeman die in a car accident.

Now, let's compare the key elements of the source story with the key elements of the comparison stories:

Story A:
- The interaction between the main characters (Gene and the policeman) is similar to the interaction between Pierre and the falcon in the source story.
- The consequences of the interaction (both characters dying) are also similar.
- However, the source story involves a lesson being taught by the falcon, which is not present in Story A.

Story B:
- The interaction between the main characters (Gene and the policeman) is similar to the interaction between Pierre and the falcon in the source story.
- The consequences of the interaction (both characters dying) are also similar.
- The source story involves a lesson being taught by the falcon, which is present in Story B as the policeman grabbing Gene to teach him a lesson.

Based on this analysis, Story B is more analogous to the source story because it shares more key elements with the source story, including the lesson being taught by one character to another. Therefore, the correct answer is:
