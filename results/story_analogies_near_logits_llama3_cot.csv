Karla, an old hawk, lived at the top of a tall oak tree. One afternoon, she saw a hunter on the ground with a bow and some crude arrows that had no feathers. The hunter took aim and shot at the hawk but missed. Karla knew the hunter wanted her feathers so she glided down to the hunter and offered to give him a few.

One day Zerdia was nesting high on a rocky cliff when she saw the sportsman coming with a crossbow. Zerdia flew down to meet the man, but he attacked and felled her with a single bolt. As she fluttered to the ground Zerdia realized that the bolt had her own tailfeathers on it.

* Two pioneers, Smith and Johnson, discover a valley in Oregon Territory.
* They fight over who saw it first, but then Sheriff Jones divides the land evenly between them.
* As a result, they become best friends and help each other build their houses.

**Story A:**

* Baggle and Norton are settlers who discover a canyon out west.
* They argue over who saw it first, but Constable Leigh takes the canyon for himself.
* Baggle and Norton realize too late that they should have divided it up.

**Story B:**

* Baggle and Norton are settlers who discover a canyon out west.
* They argue over who saw it first, but Constable Leigh divides the canyon between them.

* Both stories have two settlers, Baggle and Norton, who discover a new territory (canyon) and argue over ownership.
* In both stories, a third party (Constable Leigh) intervenes and takes action regarding the territory.
* However, in Story A, Constable Leigh takes the canyon for himself,",B,B,True,1.734375,4.21875
