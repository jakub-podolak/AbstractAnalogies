Which of the stories A/B are analogous to the source story?

Let's think step by step. Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans> at the end.

Only one answer is correct.","Let's analyze the stories:

Story A: The main character, Kevin, is a shut-in at a mental institution. He dislikes the weekly bedroom checks and spends most of his time daydreaming. The matron promises him a cake from the bakery if he cleans and organizes his bedroom. Kevin is too far behind in his cleaning to get his bedroom ready in time, so he doesn't get the cake.

Story B: The main character, Kevin, is also a shut-in at a mental institution. He dislikes cleaning his room and always fails the weekly bedroom checks. The matron promises him a cake from the bakery if he cleans and organizes his bedroom. Kevin is extremely happy and spends most of his time dreaming about the bakery and deciding what kind of cake to get. As a result, he doesn't clean his bedroom and doesn't get the cake.

Now, let's compare these stories to the source story:

* Both stories feature a main character who is a shut-in at a mental institution.
* Both characters dislike the regular room inspections/bedroom checks.
* Both characters are motivated by the promise of a treat (gingerbread/cake) to clean their room.
* Both characters fail to clean their room and don't get the treat.

The key similarity between the source story and Story A is that Kevin is too far behind in his cleaning to get his bedroom ready in time, which is similar to William's situation in the source story. In Story B, Kevin's failure to clean his room is due to his excessive daydreaming about the bakery, which is not a direct parallel to William's situation.

Story A and Story B are identical, except for the fact that Story A mentions ""Not long before the last check of the year"" while Story B doesn't specify a time frame.

* A promise of a treat (gingerbread/cake) if they clean their room
* The patient/shut-in failing to clean their room and not getting the treat

However, the key difference is that the source story explicitly states that William spent most of his time daydreaming about food, while Story A/B only mention that Kevin likes to eat, but don't specify that he spends most of his time daydreaming.

Only one answer is correct.","Let's analyze the stories step by step:

1. In the source story, an inventor perfects a new metal that stays sharper than any previous razor, and Mr. Newton, the manager, cuts himself while using one of these new razors. As a result, the inventor recommends a safety feature, and Mr. Newton agrees that it's necessary.
2. In story A, an engineer perfects a new steel alloy, and Mr. Boyce, the director, cuts himself while using one of these new knives. The engineer recommends a protective part, and Mr. Boyce agrees that it's necessary.
3. In story B, an engineer perfects a new steel alloy, and recommends a protective part because it's so sharp. However, Mr. Boyce doesn't think the protective part is necessary because it would be too expensive. Later, Mr. Boyce cuts himself while using one of these new blades, and then agrees that the protective part is necessary.

The key similarity between the source story and story A is that both involve the manager/director cutting themselves while using the new product, and then agreeing that a safety feature is necessary.

Let's think step by step. Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans> at the end.

Only one answer is correct.","Let's analyze the stories:

Story A: Zerdia, an eagle, donates her tailfeathers to a sportsman, who promises to never attack eagles. However, when the sportsman sees Zerdia again, he attacks and kills her, using a bolt with her own tailfeathers.

Story B: Zerdia, an eagle, sees a sportsman with a crossbow and no feathers. She realizes the sportsman wants her tailfeathers, so she flies down and donates a few. The sportsman is pleased and promises to never attack eagles again.

The source story: Karla, a hawk, sees a hunter with a bow and no feathers. She realizes the hunter wants her feathers, so she glides down and offers to give him a few. The hunter is grateful and promises to never shoot at a hawk again.

The key elements that make a story analogous to the source story are:

1. The bird (hawk/eagle) realizes the hunter/sportsman wants its feathers.
2. The bird offers to give the hunter/sportsman its feathers.
3. The hunter/sportsman is grateful and makes a promise (to never shoot at a hawk again or to never attack eagles again).

Story B matches these elements, while Story A does not. In Story A, the sportsman attacks and kills Zerdia, which is not analogous to the source story.

2. Both characters want to impress others with a dark tan.
3. Both characters spend time in the sun, but:
	* In story A, Alfred doesn't realize the risk of sunburn and gets a terrible sunburn.
	* In story B, a doctor acquaintance warns Alfred about the risk of sunburn, but Alfred is still annoyed and decides to leave.
4. The key difference is that story A lacks the warning from a doctor, whereas story B includes this warning.

Comparing these points to the source story:

* The source story also involves a character from a cold climate (Iceland) who wants to impress others with a tan.
* The character, Peter, spends time in the sun without realizing the risk and gets second-degree burns.
* The story does not include a warning from a doctor or any other character.

1. Both stories A and B feature an emperor who is obsessed with war and treasure.
2. In both stories, the emperor's advisor complains that they are spending too much on war and not enough on maintaining the empire/kingdom.
3. In both stories, the emperor initially ignores the advisor's warning and continues to prioritize war.
4. In both stories, the emperor suffers an injury when their carriage/coach crashes through an unmaintained bridge/overpass.
5. The injury serves as a wake-up call for the emperor, making them realize the importance of balancing their spending between war and maintaining their empire/kingdom.

The key similarity between the source story and story B is that the emperor's injury occurs when their carriage crashes through an unmaintained bridge/overpass, which is a direct result of their neglect of maintaining their empire's infrastructure. This is not the case in story A, where the emperor's injury occurs when an overpass collapses under their horse-drawn coach, but it is not explicitly stated that the overpass was unmaintained.

The key difference between the stories is what Constable Leigh does. In the source story and story A, Constable Leigh divides the land between the two settlers. In story B, Constable Leigh takes the canyon for himself.

Since story A matches the outcome of the source story, where Constable Leigh divides the land between the two settlers, it is the analogous story.

Let's think step by step. Provide the final answer in tags: <ans> A </ans> or <ans> B </ans> at the end.

Only one answer is correct.","Let's analyze the stories step by step:

1. In the source story, Mrs. Jackson is a teacher who wants a salary increase. The principal increases his own salary by 20%, but says there's no money for teacher raises. Mrs. Jackson becomes angry and takes revenge by setting fire to the principal's office.
2. In story A, Professor McGhee wants a raise. The provost gives himself a raise, but says there's no money for others. Professor McGhee becomes upset and decides to get even, blowing up the administration building with dynamite.
3. In story B, Professor McGhee wants a raise. She becomes impatient and uses kerosene to burn down the administration building. After the fire, the provost gives himself a raise, but says there's no money for others due to the fire.

Comparing the stories, we can see that:

* In both story A and the source story, the person seeking a raise (Mrs. Jackson/Professor McGhee) becomes angry/disappointed when the person in power (principal/provost) gives themselves a raise but denies others.
* In both stories, the person seeking a raise takes revenge/acts impulsively in response to their disappointment (setting fire to the principal's office/blowing up the administration building).

However, there is a key difference between the stories: the motivation and actions of the person seeking a raise. In the source story, Mrs. Jackson sets fire to the principal's office, while in story A, Professor McGhee blows up the administration building with dynamite. This difference in action makes story A more analogous to the source story.

Comparing the stories, we can see that:

2. In both stories, the snake bites the bird, causing harm.
3. In both stories, the bird grabs the snake and takes to the air with it.
4. In both stories, the bird becomes too weak to continue flying due to the snake's bite.
5. In both stories, they both fall from the sky and die.

The only difference between the two stories is the order of events. In story A, the snake panics and bites the bird before they take to the air. In story B, the bird grabs the snake and takes to the air, and then the snake panics and bites the bird.
